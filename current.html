            <h1><strong>Summary of User Rights and Privileges Relating to Smoking Cannabis</strong></h1>
<h2><strong>Rights and Privileges</strong></h2>
<p>According to California law, a user who is 21 years or older has the <strong>right</strong> to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Possess, process, transport, purchase, obtain, or give away up to <strong>28.5 grams</strong> of cannabis (not in the form of concentrated cannabis).</li>
<li>Possess up to <strong>eight grams</strong> of cannabis in the form of concentrated cannabis.</li>
<li>Cultivate <strong>up to six living cannabis plants</strong> and possess the cannabis produced by those plants.</li>
<li>Smoke or ingest cannabis or cannabis products.</li>
<li>Possess, transport, purchase, obtain, use, manufacture, or give away cannabis accessories to persons <strong>21 years of age or older</strong> without any compensation (Cal. HSC § 11362.1).</li>
</ul>
<p>Users also have the right to consume nonmedical marijuana if they are over 21 years of age and in compliance with California law and any applicable local standards, requirements, and regulations (Cal. CIV § 1550.5). They have the right to use cannabis off the job and away from the workplace without facing discrimination in hiring, termination, or any term or condition of employment based on that use (Cal. GOV § 12954).</p>
<h2><strong>Restrictions</strong></h2>
<p>However, there are restrictions on these rights. Users cannot:</p>
<ul>
<li>Smoke or ingest cannabis in public places or where smoking tobacco is prohibited.</li>
<li>Smoke or ingest cannabis within <strong>1,000 feet of a school, day care center, or youth center while children are present</strong>, or on their grounds.</li>
<li>Possess an open container or package of cannabis or cannabis products while operating a vehicle or transportation vehicle.</li>
<li>Smoke or ingest cannabis or cannabis products while driving or riding in a vehicle used for transportation (Cal. HSC § 11362.3).</li>
</ul>
<p>Users also cannot smoke cannabis:</p>

<li>On the grounds of certain facilities or institutions.</li>
<li>On the property of a state or local government agency or on privately owned property where it is prohibited or restricted (Cal. HSC § 11362.45).</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Local Jurisdiction Regulations</strong></h2>
<p>User rights and privileges relating to smoking cannabis can also depend on the local jurisdiction's regulations. Local jurisdictions have the authority to adopt and enforce ordinances to regulate businesses licensed under this division, including regulations related to reducing exposure to secondhand smoke (Cal. BPC § 26200).</p>
<h2><strong>Medical Cannabis</strong></h2>
<p>For medical cannabis users, they have the right to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transport, process, administer, deliver, or give away cannabis for medical purposes if they are a qualified patient, a person with an identification card, or a designated primary caregiver (Cal. HSC § 11362.765).</li>
<li>Request the court to confirm their right to use cannabis while on probation or released on bail (Cal. HSC § 11362.795).</li>
</ul>
<p>However, users do not have the right or privilege to smoke or vape cannabis in a health care facility (Cal. HSC § 1649.2). They also cannot smoke medicinal cannabis:</p>
<ul>
<li>In a place where smoking is prohibited by law.</li>
<li>Within 1,000 feet of the grounds of a school, recreation center, or youth center, unless the medicinal use occurs within a residence, on a school bus, while in a motor vehicle that is being operated, or while operating a boat (Cal. HSC § 11362.79).</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Cultivation</strong></h2>
<p>Users also have the right to cultivate and possess cannabis for personal use, but there are certain restrictions that apply. The cultivation of cannabis must comply with local ordinances, if any, and must be done within the person's private residence or on the grounds of that private residence in a locked space that is not visible from a public place (Cal. HSC § 11362.2).</p>
<h2><strong>Other Rights</strong></h2>
<p>Users also have the right to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have cannabis or cannabis products tested by a licensed testing laboratory for quality control purposes (Cal. BPC § 26104).</li>
<li>Purchase and possess cannabis or cannabis products if they are <strong>21 years of age or older</strong> (Cal. BPC § 26140).</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>In conclusion, while users have certain rights and privileges relating to smoking cannabis, there are also restrictions and limitations on these rights. These rights and privileges can also be regulated by local ordinances.</p>

        <h2>How Abe Works</h2>
        <p>Abe operates by leveraging a rich database that contains the full text of the California Legal Code, obtained through meticulous scraping of official government documentation. The data undergoes a rigorous cleaning process, with key features extracted and stored efficiently, facilitating rapid and accurate responses to user queries.</p>
        <p>The backend relies on Python 3.8.9 and incorporates a range of technologies including PostgreSQL for database management and OpenAI for embedding text and facilitating intelligent search. As the project progresses, we aim to integrate the functionalities of GPT 3.5 Turbo or even GPT 4.0 to enhance Abe's capabilities further.</p>
        <p>We are at the initial stages, but the roadmap is promising, and we are excited to continue developing Abe into a tool that stands by every citizen, offering them the legal information they seek efficiently and accurately.</p>
