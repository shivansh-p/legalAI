# Cannabis Usage Restrictions

Smoking or ingestion of cannabis in public places prohibited areas for tobacco smoking is not allowed. This restriction extends to facilities, institutions, state or local government property, and within 1,000 feet of schools, daycare centers, or youth centers while children are present (Cal. HSC § 11362.3, § 11362.45).

Smoking or ingesting cannabis while driving a motor vehicle, boat, vessel, or aircraft is prohibited. Similarly, possession of open containers of cannabis while operating a vehicle is unlawful (Cal. HSC § 11362.3, Cal. HSC § 11362.45).

## Workplace Restrictions

Employers have the right to maintain a drug and alcohol-free workplace. They can prohibit the use of cannabis by employees and prospective employees (Cal. HSC § 11362.45, Cal. GOV § 12954).

### On Job Sites
Smoking cannabis on the job or on the premises of a workplace during work hours is prohibited (Cal. HSC § 11362.785).

Medical cannabis use exceptions exist. A parent or guardian to a qualified patient can administer medicinal cannabis at a school site under certain conditions (Cal. HSC § 49414.1). Also, qualified patients or their caregivers can transport, process, administer, deliver, or give medicinal cannabis (Cal. HSC § 11362.765).

Users qualified for medical cannabis can request from the court for approval to use cannabis while on probation, bail, or parole (Cal. HSC § 11362.795).

# Local Jurisdictional Regulation
## Local Rules
Local jurisdictions can create and enforce ordinances to regulate the location, operation, or establishment of a medicinal cannabis cooperative or collective. Also, local jurisdictions can create rules to regulate businesses licensed under this division. The local jurisdiction can't prohibit the purchase and delivery of medicinal cannabis, but it can impose reasonable regulations relating to zoning requirements, security, public health and safety, licensing, and taxes (Cal. BPC § 26200, Cal. HSC § 11362.83, Cal. BPC § 26322).

#User Discrimination Protection
## Employment Discrimination

Users have the right to have cannabis products tested for quality control purposes by a licensed testing laboratory (Cal. BPC § 26104).

## Accommodating Medical Needs
### Medical Needs Exception 
If a physician recommends that the defined quantity does not meet the patient's needs, a patient may possess an amount of cannabis consistent with the patient's needs (Cal. HSC § 11362.77). Local counties may also have guidelines that allow patients or primary caregivers to exceed the state limits.
