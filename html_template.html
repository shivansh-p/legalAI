            <h1> === How to Utilize Abe ===</h1>
            <div class="abe-info">
                <h3>How do I ask Abe a legal question?</h3>
                <p>Visit the <a href="#Playground">playground</a> and pose any legal question. Abe will respond based on the relevant information in the California Legal Code.</p>
                <h3>What type of legal questions can Abe answer?</h3>
                <p>Abe is equipped to address any well-phrased legal question that is rooted in the legal code. For instance:</p>
                <blockquote>Can I smoke cannabis?</blockquote>
                <h3>Which legal documents is Abe familiar with?</h3>
                <p>Abe comprehends the entire <a href="link-to-California-code">California State legal code</a>. Rather than being specifically trained or fine-tuned on this data, he utilizes underlying algorithms to reference relevant legal sections as guidelines for his responses.</p>
                <p>While Abe operates under the assumption that all questions are within the jurisdiction of California, he can include references to specific local or federal legislation in his answers if they're part of the California legal code.</p>
                <p>Plans are in place to soon incorporate all US States and Federal Code and Regulations. The priority is to enhance the accuracy, speed, utility, and authenticity of Abe's responses before broadening the covered jurisdictions.</p>

        <h2>Behind the Scenes: How Abe Operates</h2>
        <p>By leveraging a comprehensive database that encompasses the full text of the California Legal Code, sourced from meticulous web scraping of official documents, Abe ensures accuracy. This data is subject to a detailed cleaning process, with pivotal features extracted and stored for quick and precise user query responses.</p>
        <p>The infrastructure is grounded in Python 3.8.9 and encompasses technologies like PostgreSQL for database management and OpenAI for text embedding and smart search functions. As we advance, the goal is to incorporate functionalities from GPT 3.5 Turbo and potentially GPT 4.0 to further amplify Abe's capabilities.</p>
        <p>The journey has just begun, but the roadmap is filled with promise. Our aim is to evolve Abe into a dependable tool for every citizen, granting them swift and accurate legal information.</p>
