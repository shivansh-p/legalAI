(D)\u00a0The court reporter is unable to capture the verbatim record and certify a transcript of any proceeding that is conducted remotely, in whole or in part, to the same extent and in the same manner as if it were not conducted remotely.(E)\u00a0The quality of the technology or audibility at a proceeding inhibits the ability of the person to understand or participate in the proceeding.(F)\u00a0The quality of the technology or audibility at a proceeding inhibits counsel from being able to provide effective representation to the person.

The court\u2019s determination shall be based on the individual case before the court and shall be entered into the minutes or otherwise made on the record. In making its determination, the court shall\n\t\t\t\t  consider the request of the person, the nature of the proceedings, and whether requiring the physical presence of the person would disrupt the person\u2019s program of treatment or be detrimental to their mental or physical health.(3)\u00a0The court shall not continue proceedings beyond statutory time limits pursuant to this section absent a waiver by the person in consultation with counsel.(i)\u00a0Subject to the limitations in subdivision (h), this section is not intended to prohibit the use of appearances through the use of remote technology when stipulated by attorneys for represented parties.(j)\u00a0Before the court may conduct proceedings through the use of remote technology, the court shall have a process for a party, witness, official reporter, official reporter pro tempore, court interpreter, or other court personnel to\n\t\t\t\t  alert the judicial officer of technology or audibility issues that arise during the proceedings.(k)\u00a0The court shall inform all parties, particularly parties without legal representation, about the potential technological or audibility issues that could arise when using remote technology, which may require a delay of or halt the proceedings. The court shall make information available to self-represented parties regarding the options for appearing in person and through the use of remote technology. (l)\u00a0A self-represented party may appear remotely in a proceeding conducted through the use of remote technology only if they agree to do so.(m)\u00a0For purposes of this section, a party includes a nonparty subject to Chapter 6 (commencing with Section 2020.010) of Title 4 of Part 4.(n)\u00a0Consistent with its constitutional rulemaking authority, the Judicial Council shall adopt such other rules and standards as are necessary to implement the policies and provisions of this section and the intent of the Legislature. (o)\u00a0 By April 1, 2024, the Judicial Council shall adopt, and trial courts shall implement by July 1, 2024, minimum standards for the courtroom technology necessary to permit remote participation in proceedings subject to this section. Those standards shall include, but not be limited to, hard-wired or other reliable high-speed internet connections in the courtroom for the judicial officer and court reporter, and monitors, dedicated cameras, speakers, and microphones so the judicial officer, court reporter, and court interpreter can appropriately see and hear remote participants, as well as to ensure that remote participants can appropriately see and hear\n\t\t\t\t  the judicial officer and other courtroom participants.(p)\u00a0Consistent with federal and California labor law, a trial court shall not retaliate or threaten to retaliate against an official reporter or an official reporter pro tempore who notifies the judicial officer that technology or audibility issues are impeding the creation of the verbatim record of a proceeding that includes participation through remote technology. This subdivision shall only apply to an official reporter and an official reporter pro tempore when they meet the definition of \u201ctrial court employee\u201d under subdivision (l) of Section 71601 of the Government Code.(q)\u00a0This section shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2026, and as of that date is repealed.", "16939": null, "16946": "527.85 (a)\u00a0Any chief administrative officer of a postsecondary educational institution, or an officer or employee designated by the chief administrative officer to maintain order on the school campus or facility, a student of which has suffered a credible threat of violence made off the school campus or facility from any individual which can reasonably be construed to be carried out or to have been carried out\n at the school campus or facility, may, with the written consent of the student, seek a temporary restraining order and an order after hearing on behalf of the student and, at the discretion of the court, any number of other students at the campus or facility who are similarly situated.(c)\u00a0This section does not permit a court\n to issue a temporary restraining order or order after hearing prohibiting speech or other activities that are constitutionally protected, or otherwise protected by Section 527.3 or any other provision of law.(d)\u00a0In the discretion of the court, on a showing of good cause, a temporary restraining order or order after hearing issued under this section may include other named family or household members of the student, or other students at the campus or facility.(e)\u00a0Upon filing a petition under this section, the petitioner may obtain a temporary restraining order in accordance with subdivision (a) of Section 527, if the petitioner also files a declaration that, to the satisfaction of the court, shows reasonable proof that a student has suffered a credible threat of violence made off the school campus or facility by the respondent, and that great or irreparable harm would result to\n the student.

For purposes of this clause, \u201cnatural infrastructure\u201d means using natural ecological systems or processes to reduce vulnerability to climate change related hazards, or other related climate change effects, while increasing the long-term adaptive capacity of coastal and inland areas by perpetuating or restoring ecosystem services. This includes, but is not limited to, the conservation, preservation, or sustainable management of any form of aquatic or terrestrial vegetated open space, such as beaches, dunes, tidal marshes, reefs, seagrass, parks, rain gardens, and urban tree canopies. It also\n\t\t\t\t  includes systems and practices that use or mimic natural processes, such as permeable pavements, bioswales, and other engineered systems, such as levees that are combined with restored natural systems, to provide clean water, conserve ecosystem values and functions, and provide a wide array of benefits to people and wildlife.(D)\u00a0(i)\u00a0If a city or county has adopted the local hazard mitigation plan, or other climate adaptation plan or document that fulfills commensurate goals and objectives and contains the information required pursuant to this paragraph, separate from the general plan, an attachment of, or reference to, the local hazard mitigation plan or other climate adaptation plan or document.(ii)\u00a0Cities or counties that have an adopted hazard mitigation plan, or other climate adaptation plan or document that substantially complies with this section, or\n\t\t\t\t  have substantially equivalent provisions to this subdivision in their general plans, may use that information in the safety element to comply with this subdivision, and shall summarize and incorporate by reference into the safety element the other general plan provisions, climate adaptation plan or document, specifically showing how each requirement of this subdivision has been met.(5)\u00a0Upon the next revision of the housing element on or after January 1, 2020, the safety element shall be reviewed and updated as necessary to identify residential developments in any hazard area identified in the safety element that do not have at least two emergency evacuation routes.(6)\u00a0After the initial revision of the safety element pursuant to paragraphs (2), (3), (4), and (5), the planning agency shall review and, if necessary, revise the safety element upon each revision of the housing\n\t\t\t\t  element or local hazard mitigation plan, but not less than once every eight years, to identify new information relating to flood and fire hazards and climate adaptation and resiliency strategies applicable to the city or county that was not available during the previous revision of the safety element.(7)\u00a0Cities and counties that have flood plain management ordinances that have been approved by FEMA that substantially comply with this section, or have substantially equivalent provisions to this subdivision in their general plans, may use that information in the safety element to comply with this subdivision, and shall summarize and incorporate by reference into the safety element the other general plan provisions or the flood plain ordinance, specifically showing how each requirement of this subdivision has been met.(8)\u00a0Before the periodic review of its general plan and before\n\t\t\t\t  preparing or revising its safety element, each city and county shall consult the California Geological Survey of the Department of Conservation, the Central Valley Flood Protection Board, if the city or county is located within the boundaries of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Drainage District, as set forth in Section 8501 of the Water Code, and the Office of Emergency Services for the purpose of including information known by and available to the department, the agency, and the board required by this subdivision.(9)\u00a0To the extent that a county\u2019s safety element is sufficiently detailed and contains appropriate policies and programs for adoption by a city, a city may adopt that portion of the county\u2019s safety element that pertains to the city\u2019s planning area in satisfaction of the requirement imposed by this subdivision.(h)\u00a0(1)\u00a0An environmental justice\n\t\t\t\t  element, or related goals, policies, and objectives integrated in other elements, that identifies disadvantaged communities within the area covered by the general plan of the city, county, or city and county, if the city, county, or city and county has a disadvantaged community. The environmental justice element, or related environmental justice goals, policies, and objectives integrated in other elements, shall do all of the following:(A)\u00a0Identify objectives and policies to reduce the unique or compounded health risks in disadvantaged communities by means that include, but are not limited to, the reduction of pollution exposure, including the improvement of air quality, and the promotion of public facilities, food access, safe and sanitary homes, and physical activity.(B)\u00a0Identify objectives and policies to promote civic engagement in the public decisionmaking process.(C)\u00a0Identify objectives and policies that prioritize improvements and programs that address the needs of disadvantaged communities.(2)\u00a0A city, county, or city and county subject to this subdivision shall adopt or review the environmental justice element, or the environmental justice goals, policies, and objectives in other elements, upon the adoption or next revision of two or more elements concurrently on or after January 1, 2018.(3)\u00a0By adding this subdivision, the Legislature does not intend to require a city, county, or city and county to take any action prohibited by the United States Constitution or the California Constitution.(4)\u00a0For purposes of this subdivision, the following terms shall apply:(A)\u00a0\u201cDisadvantaged communities\u201d means an area identified by the California Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to Section 39711 of the Health and Safety Code or an area that is a low-income area that is disproportionately affected by environmental pollution and other hazards that can lead to negative health effects, exposure, or environmental degradation.(B)\u00a0\u201cPublic facilities\u201d includes public improvements, public services, and community amenities, as defined in subdivision (d) of Section 66000.(C)\u00a0\u201cLow-income area\u201d means an area with household incomes at or below 80 percent of the statewide median income or with household incomes at or below the threshold designated as low income by the Department of Housing and Community Development\u2019s list of state income limits adopted pursuant to Section 50093 of the Health and Safety\n\t\t\t\t  Code.", "78490": null, "78520": null, "78553": "65589.5 (a)\u00a0(1)\u00a0The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:(A)\u00a0The lack of housing, including emergency shelters, is a critical problem that threatens the economic, environmental, and social quality of life in California.(B)\u00a0California housing has become the most expensive in the nation. The excessive cost of the state\u2019s housing supply is partially caused by activities and policies of many local governments that limit the approval of housing, increase the cost of land for housing, and require that high fees and exactions be paid by producers of housing.(C)\u00a0Among the consequences of those actions are\n\t\t\t\t  discrimination against low-income and minority households, lack of housing to support employment growth, imbalance in jobs and housing, reduced mobility, urban sprawl, excessive commuting, and air quality deterioration.(D)\u00a0Many local governments do not give adequate attention to the economic, environmental, and social costs of decisions that result in disapproval of housing development projects, reduction in density of housing projects, and excessive standards for housing development projects.(2)\u00a0In enacting the amendments made to this section by the act adding this paragraph, the Legislature further finds and declares the following:(A)\u00a0California has a housing supply and affordability crisis of historic proportions. The consequences of failing to effectively and aggressively confront this crisis are hurting\n\t\t\t\t  millions of Californians, robbing future generations of the chance to call California home, stifling economic opportunities for workers and businesses, worsening poverty and homelessness, and undermining the state\u2019s environmental and climate objectives.(B)\u00a0While the causes of this crisis are multiple and complex, the absence of meaningful and effective policy reforms to significantly enhance the approval and supply of housing affordable to Californians of all income levels is a key factor.(C)\u00a0The crisis has grown so acute in California that supply, demand, and affordability fundamentals are characterized in the negative: underserved demands, constrained supply, and protracted unaffordability.(D)\u00a0According to reports and data, California has accumulated an unmet housing backlog of nearly 2,000,000 units and must\n\t\t\t\t  provide for at least 180,000 new units annually to keep pace with growth through 2025.(E)\u00a0California\u2019s overall homeownership rate is at its lowest level since the 1940s. The state ranks 49th out of the 50 states in homeownership rates as well as in the supply of housing per capita. Only one-half of California\u2019s households are able to afford the cost of housing in their local regions.(F)\u00a0Lack of supply and rising costs are compounding inequality and limiting advancement opportunities for many Californians.(G)\u00a0The majority of California renters, more than 3,000,000 households, pay more than 30 percent of their income toward rent and nearly one-third, more than 1,500,000 households, pay more than 50 percent of their income toward rent.(H)\u00a0When\n\t\t\t\t  Californians have access to safe and affordable housing, they have more money for food and health care; they are less likely to become homeless and in need of government-subsidized services; their children do better in school; and businesses have an easier time recruiting and retaining employees.(I)\u00a0An additional consequence of the state\u2019s cumulative housing shortage is a significant increase in greenhouse gas emissions caused by the displacement and redirection of populations to states with greater housing opportunities, particularly working- and middle-class households. California\u2019s cumulative housing shortfall therefore has not only national but international environmental consequences.(J)\u00a0California\u2019s housing picture has reached a crisis of historic proportions despite the fact that, for decades, the Legislature has enacted numerous statutes intended to significantly\n\t\t\t\t  increase the approval, development, and affordability of housing for all income levels, including this section.(K)\u00a0The Legislature\u2019s intent in enacting this section in 1982 and in expanding its provisions since then was to significantly increase the approval and construction of new housing for all economic segments of California\u2019s communities by meaningfully and effectively curbing the capability of local governments to deny, reduce the density for, or render infeasible housing development projects and emergency shelters. That intent has not been fulfilled.(L)\u00a0It is the policy of the state that this section be interpreted and implemented in a manner to afford the fullest possible weight to the interest of, and the approval and provision of, housing.(3)\u00a0It is the intent of the Legislature that the conditions that\n\t\t\t\t  would have a specific, adverse impact upon the public health and safety, as described in paragraph (2) of subdivision (d) and paragraph (1) of subdivision (j), arise infrequently.(b)\u00a0It is the policy of the state that a local government not reject or make infeasible housing development projects, including emergency shelters, that contribute to meeting the need determined pursuant to this article without a thorough analysis of the economic, social, and environmental effects of the action and without complying with subdivision (d).(c)\u00a0The Legislature also recognizes that premature and unnecessary development of agricultural lands for urban uses continues to have adverse effects on the availability of those lands for food and fiber production and on the economy of the state. Furthermore, it is the policy of the state that development should be guided away from prime agricultural\n\t\t\t\t  lands; therefore, in implementing this section, local jurisdictions should encourage, to the maximum extent practicable, in filling existing urban areas.(d)\u00a0A local agency shall not disapprove a housing development project, including farmworker housing as defined in subdivision (h) of Section 50199.7 of the Health and Safety Code, for very low, low-, or moderate-income households, or an emergency shelter, or condition approval in a manner that renders the housing development project infeasible for development for the use of very low, low-, or moderate-income households, or an emergency shelter, including through the use of design review standards, unless it makes written findings, based upon a preponderance of the evidence in the record, as to one of the following:(1)\u00a0The jurisdiction has adopted a housing element pursuant to this article that has been revised in accordance with\n\t\t\t\t  Section 65588, is in substantial compliance with this article, and the jurisdiction has met or exceeded its share of the regional housing need allocation pursuant to Section 65584 for the planning period for the income category proposed for the housing development project, provided that any disapproval or conditional approval shall not be based on any of the reasons prohibited by Section 65008. If the housing development project includes a mix of income categories, and the jurisdiction has not met or exceeded its share of the regional housing need for one or more of those categories, then this paragraph shall not be used to disapprove or conditionally approve the housing development project. The share of the regional housing need met by the jurisdiction shall be calculated consistently with the forms and definitions that may be adopted by the Department of Housing and Community Development pursuant to Section 65400. In the case of an emergency shelter, the jurisdiction shall have met or exceeded the need for\n\t\t\t\t  emergency shelter, as identified pursuant to paragraph (7) of subdivision (a) of Section 65583. Any disapproval or conditional approval pursuant to this paragraph shall be in accordance with applicable law, rule, or standards.(2)\u00a0The housing development project or emergency shelter as proposed would have a specific, adverse impact upon the public health or safety, and there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact without rendering the development unaffordable to low- and moderate-income households or rendering the development of the emergency shelter financially infeasible. As used in this paragraph, a \u201cspecific, adverse impact\u201d means a significant, quantifiable, direct, and unavoidable impact, based on objective, identified written public health or safety standards, policies, or conditions as they existed on the date the application was deemed complete. The following shall not constitute a\n\t\t\t\t  specific, adverse impact upon the public health or safety:(A)\u00a0Inconsistency with the zoning ordinance or general plan land use designation.(B)\u00a0The eligibility to claim a welfare exemption under subdivision (g) of Section 214 of the Revenue and Taxation Code.(3)\u00a0The denial of the housing development project or imposition of conditions is required in order to comply with specific state or federal law, and there is no feasible method to comply without rendering the development unaffordable to low- and moderate-income households or rendering the development of the emergency shelter financially infeasible.(4)\u00a0The housing development project or emergency shelter is proposed on land zoned for agriculture or resource preservation that is surrounded on at\n\t\t\t\t  least two sides by land being used for agricultural or resource preservation purposes, or which does not have adequate water or wastewater facilities to serve the project.(5)\u00a0The housing development project or emergency shelter is inconsistent with both the jurisdiction\u2019s zoning ordinance and general plan land use designation as specified in any element of the general plan as it existed on the date the application was deemed complete, and the jurisdiction has adopted a revised housing element in accordance with Section 65588 that is in substantial compliance with this article. For purposes of this section, a change to the zoning ordinance or general plan land use designation subsequent to the date the application was deemed complete shall not constitute a valid basis to disapprove or condition approval of the housing development project or emergency shelter.(A)\u00a0This paragraph\n\t\t\t\t  cannot be utilized to disapprove or conditionally approve a housing development project if the housing development project is proposed on a site that is identified as suitable or available for very low, low-, or moderate-income households in the jurisdiction\u2019s housing element, and consistent with the density specified in the housing element, even though it is inconsistent with both the jurisdiction\u2019s zoning ordinance and general plan land use designation.(B)\u00a0If the local agency has failed to identify in the inventory of land in its housing element sites that can be developed for housing within the planning period and are sufficient to provide for the jurisdiction\u2019s share of the regional housing need for all income levels pursuant to Section 65584, then this paragraph shall not be utilized to disapprove or conditionally approve a housing development project proposed for a site designated in any element of the general plan for residential uses\n\t\t\t\t  or designated in any element of the general plan for commercial uses if residential uses are permitted or conditionally permitted within commercial designations. In any action in court, the burden of proof shall be on the local agency to show that its housing element does identify adequate sites with appropriate zoning and development standards and with services and facilities to accommodate the local agency\u2019s share of the regional housing need for the very low, low-, and moderate-income categories.(C)\u00a0If the local agency has failed to identify a zone or zones where emergency shelters are allowed as a permitted use without a conditional use or other discretionary permit, has failed to demonstrate that the identified zone or zones include sufficient capacity to accommodate the need for emergency shelter identified in paragraph (7) of subdivision (a) of Section 65583, or has failed to demonstrate that the identified zone or zones can accommodate\n\t\t\t\t  at least one emergency shelter, as required by paragraph (4) of subdivision (a) of Section 65583, then this paragraph shall not be utilized to disapprove or conditionally approve an emergency shelter proposed for a site designated in any element of the general plan for industrial, commercial, or multifamily residential uses. In any action in court, the burden of proof shall be on the local agency to show that its housing element does satisfy the requirements of paragraph (4) of subdivision (a) of Section 65583.(e)\u00a0Nothing in this section shall be construed to relieve the local agency from complying with the congestion management program required by Chapter 2.6 (commencing with Section 65088) of Division 1 of Title 7 or the California Coastal Act of 1976 (Division 20 (commencing with Section 30000) of the Public Resources Code). Neither shall anything in this section be construed to relieve the local agency from making one or more of the\n\t\t\t\t  findings required pursuant to Section 21081 of the Public Resources Code or otherwise complying with the California Environmental Quality Act (Division 13 (commencing with Section 21000) of the Public Resources Code).(f)\u00a0(1)\u00a0Except as provided in subdivision (o), nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a local agency from requiring the housing development project to comply with objective, quantifiable, written development standards, conditions, and policies appropriate to, and consistent with, meeting the jurisdiction\u2019s share of the regional housing need pursuant to Section 65584. However, the development standards, conditions, and policies shall be applied to facilitate and accommodate development at the density permitted on the site and proposed by the development.(2)\u00a0Except as provided in subdivision (o), nothing in this section shall be\n\t\t\t\t  construed to prohibit a local agency from requiring an emergency shelter project to comply with objective, quantifiable, written development standards, conditions, and policies that are consistent with paragraph (4) of subdivision (a) of Section 65583 and appropriate to, and consistent with, meeting the jurisdiction\u2019s need for emergency shelter, as identified pursuant to paragraph (7) of subdivision (a) of Section 65583. However, the development standards, conditions, and policies shall be applied by the local agency to facilitate and accommodate the development of the emergency shelter project.(3)\u00a0Except as provided in subdivision (o), nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a local agency from imposing fees and other exactions otherwise authorized by law that are essential to provide necessary public services and facilities to the housing development project or emergency shelter.(4)\u00a0For purposes of this section, a housing development project or emergency shelter shall be deemed consistent, compliant, and in conformity with an applicable plan, program, policy, ordinance, standard, requirement, or other similar provision if there is substantial evidence that would allow a reasonable person to conclude that the housing development project or emergency shelter is consistent, compliant, or in conformity.(g)\u00a0This section shall be applicable to charter cities because the Legislature finds that the lack of housing, including emergency shelter, is a critical statewide problem.(i)\u00a0If any city, county, or city and county denies approval or imposes conditions, including design changes, lower density, or a reduction of the percentage of a lot that may be occupied by a building or structure under the applicable planning and zoning in force at the time the housing development project\u2019s application is complete, that have a substantial adverse effect on the viability or affordability of a housing development for very low, low-, or moderate-income households, and the denial of the development or the imposition of conditions on the development is the subject of a court action which challenges the denial or the imposition of conditions, then\n\t\t\t\t  the burden of proof shall be on the local legislative body to show that its decision is consistent with the findings as described in subdivision (d), and that the findings are supported by a preponderance of the evidence in the record, and with the requirements of subdivision (o).(j)\u00a0(1)\u00a0When a proposed housing development project complies with applicable, objective general plan, zoning, and subdivision standards and criteria, including design review standards, in effect at the time that the application was deemed complete, but the local agency proposes to disapprove the project or to impose a condition that the project be developed at a lower density, the local agency shall base its decision regarding the proposed housing development project upon written findings supported by a preponderance of the evidence on the record that both of the following conditions exist:(A)\u00a0The housing development project would have a specific, adverse impact upon the public health or safety unless the project is disapproved or approved upon the condition that the project be developed at a lower density.

For unoccupied dwelling units described in subparagraph (A) in a development with occupied units, the proposed housing development shall provide units of equivalent size to be made available at affordable rent or affordable housing cost to, and occupied by, persons and families in the same or lower income category as the last household in occupancy. If the income category of the last household in occupancy is not known, it shall be rebuttably presumed that lower income renter households occupied these units in the same proportion of lower income renter\n\t\t\t\t  households to all renter households within the jurisdiction, as determined by the most recently available data from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy database.

If a court finds that the refusal to grant a requested density bonus, incentive, or concession is in violation of this section, the court shall award the plaintiff reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs of suit. This subdivision shall not be interpreted to require a local government to grant an incentive or concession that has a specific, adverse impact, as defined in paragraph (2) of subdivision (d) of Section 65589.5, upon health or\n\t\t\t\t  safety, and for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact.

Subject to paragraph (3), an applicant may submit to a city, county, or city and county a proposal for the waiver or reduction of development standards that will have the effect of physically precluding the construction of a development meeting the criteria of subdivision (b) at the densities or with the concessions or incentives permitted under this section, and may request a meeting with the city, county, or city and county. If a court finds that the refusal to grant a waiver or reduction of development standards is in violation of this section, the court shall award the plaintiff reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs of suit. This subdivision shall not be interpreted to require a local government to waive or reduce development standards if the waiver or reduction would have a specific, adverse impact, as defined in paragraph (2) of subdivision (d) of Section 65589.5, upon health or safety, and for which there is no feasible\n\t\t\t\t  method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact. This subdivision shall not be interpreted to require a local government to waive or reduce development standards that would have an adverse impact on any real property that is listed in the California Register of Historical Resources, or to grant any waiver or reduction that would be contrary to state or federal law.(2)\u00a0A proposal for the waiver or reduction of development standards pursuant to this subdivision shall neither reduce nor increase the number of incentives or concessions to which the applicant is entitled pursuant to subdivision (d).(3)\u00a0A housing development that receives a waiver from any maximum controls on density pursuant to clause (ii) of subparagraph (D) of paragraph (3) of subdivision (f) shall only be eligible for a waiver or reduction of development standards as provided in subparagraph\n\t\t\t\t  (D) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (d) and clause (ii) of subparagraph (D) of paragraph (3) of subdivision (f), unless the city, county, or city and county agrees to additional waivers or reductions of development standards.(f)\u00a0For the purposes of this chapter, \u201cdensity bonus\u201d means a density increase over the otherwise maximum allowable gross residential density as of the date of application by the applicant to the city, county, or city and county, or, if elected by the applicant, a lesser percentage of density increase, including, but not limited to, no increase in density.

It further reaffirms that the intent is to cover at least\n\t\t\t\t  some of the financing gap of affordable housing with regulatory incentives, rather than additional public subsidy.(2)\u00a0It is therefore the intent of the Legislature to make modifications to the Density Bonus Law by the act adding this subdivision to further incentivize the construction of very low, low-, and moderate-income housing units. It is further the intent of the Legislature in making these modifications to the Density Bonus Law to ensure that any additional benefits conferred upon a developer are balanced with the receipt of a public benefit in the form of adequate levels of affordable housing.

Sec. 1395 et seq.) as skilled nursing facilities or in the federal Medicaid Program under Title XIX of the federal Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 1396 et seq.), as nursing facilities, or as both.(2)\u00a0For purposes of the pilot program, the department shall permit the formulation of standards for long-term care that may extend beyond, or vary from, traditional long-term health care facility models, including, but not limited to, facility layout and design consistent with newly adopted revisions to the California Building Standards Code, nursing care levels, staffing levels, infection control, sanitation, dietary services, and other personal care and habilitation provisions that may be more flexible than those currently required in California for skilled nursing facilities and continuous nursing facilities.(3)\u00a0The department shall establish\n\t\t\t\t  criteria to measure the benefits and successes of this type of long-term care facility, as a whole, and to compare the results achieved by each model variant.

The applications shall include sufficient information to demonstrate the provider\u2019s experience in establishing and operating one or more care facilities offering the level of care to be furnished by pilot facilities, including the name and location of each facility currently or previously licensed to the provider, whether within California or in another state.(2)\u00a0The department may require that additional information and documents be submitted with, or subsequently in support of, the application. Failure to provide any required information or documentation shall disqualify the applicant from the application process and from consideration for\n\t\t\t\t  participation in the pilot program. The department may select providers for participation in the SHSNF PP based on the applicant\u2019s ability to meet or exceed the criteria described in this article.(m)\u00a0If, at any time, a pilot facility fails to meet the criteria set forth in this article for being a pilot facility, or fails to safeguard patient health, safety, welfare, and security as determined by the department, the department shall remove that pilot facility from participation in the pilot program.(n)\u00a0The costs of the creation, administration, and evaluation of the pilot program shall be borne by the facilities participating in the pilot project.(o)\u00a0Each pilot facility shall provide any reports to the department that the department deems necessary for modifications to the pilot program, the guidance or\n\t\t\t\t  regulations governing the pilot facilities, and any other information the pilot facilities deem relevant in evaluating the success of the pilot program in delivering improved patient care.

Many residential hotels are in poor condition and in need of rehabilitation, and many are being demolished or converted to other uses. The state can play an important role in preserving the existence and improving the quality of this housing resource through sponsoring demonstration projects that will enable local\n\t\t\t\t  sponsors to acquire, rehabilitate, maintain, or otherwise protect and improve residential hotels as a housing resource for persons of very low and low income. The demonstration projects should be undertaken and designed so as to demonstrate the feasibility of innovative methods of protecting and improving residential hotels and of improving their habitability while assuring their continued availability to persons of very low and low income.(c)\u00a0The department, in conjunction with the State Fire Marshal, shall develop a model code for the rehabilitation of residential hotels.

A ban on the use of smokeless tobacco in professional baseball takes aim at the use of smokeless tobacco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  by professional baseball players at stadiums throughout California with the goal that impressionable youth never begin to use smokeless tobacco products or associate smokeless tobacco with the sport of baseball.(3)\u00a0To promote a healthy and active lifestyle and to set a better example for youth, the Legislature urges Major League Baseball and the Major League Baseball Players Association to adopt a nationwide ban on the use of smokeless tobacco by players, managers, and coaches in public stadiums.

These arrangements are commonly referred to as \u201clarge deductible\u201d policies or programs, even though the actual amount of the deductible can vary significantly and may not be in fact large in amount. Deductible\n\t\t\t\tamounts under these arrangements may vary from as little as five thousand dollars ($5,000) to as much as $1,000,000 or more. This section shall be construed such that the claim payment obligations of the guaranty associations, including the California Insurance Guarantee Association, in total arising from deductible agreements will be substantially equivalent to those of the insurer, except as provided otherwise in each guaranty association\u2019s enabling statute, including that of the California Insurance Guarantee Association, had the insurer continued in business and not become subject to a liquidation proceeding.(b)\u00a0Notwithstanding any other provision of law or contract to the contrary, any collateral held by or for the benefit of, or assigned to, the insurer or the liquidator to secure the obligations of a policyholder under a deductible agreement and any reimbursement payments to the liquidator under a deductible agreement shall be\n\t\t\t\tconsidered property of the liquidated company, but shall not be general assets of the liquidated company. The liquidator shall maintain, administer, and distribute all such collateral and deductible reimbursement payments only as provided in this section.(c)\u00a0If a claim that is subject to a deductible agreement and secured by collateral is not covered by a guaranty association or the California Insurance Guarantee Association and the policyholder is unwilling or unable to take over the handling and payment of the noncovered claims, the liquidator shall adjust and pay the noncovered claims utilizing the collateral, but only to the extent the available collateral, after allocation under subdivision (d), is sufficient to pay all outstanding and anticipated claims. If the collateral is exhausted and the policyholder is not able to provide funds to pay the remaining claims within the deductible after all reasonable means of collection against the\n\t\t\t\tpolicyholder have been exhausted, the remaining claims shall be claims against the insurer\u2019s estate, subject to the other provisions of this article regarding the filing and allowance of claims. When the liquidator determines that the collateral is insufficient to pay all additional and anticipated claims, the liquidator may file a plan for equitably allocating the collateral among claimants, subject to court approval.(d)\u00a0(1)\u00a0To the extent that the liquidator holds collateral provided by a policyholder that was obtained to secure a deductible agreement and to secure other obligations of the policyholder to pay the insurer, directly or indirectly, amounts that become assets of the estate, such as reinsurance obligations under a captive reinsurance program or adjustable premium obligations under a retrospectively rated insurance policy or where the premium due is subject to adjustment based upon actual loss experience, the\n\t\t\t\tliquidator shall equitably allocate the collateral among those obligations and administer the collateral allocated to the deductible agreement pursuant to this section.(2)\u00a0With respect to the collateral allocated to obligations under the deductible agreement, if the collateral secured reimbursement obligations under more than one line of insurance, then the collateral shall be equitably allocated among the various lines based upon the estimated ultimate exposure within the deductible amount for each line.(3)\u00a0The liquidator shall inform the guaranty associations or the California Insurance Guarantee Association that is or may be obligated for claims against the insurer of the method and details of each allocation made pursuant to this subdivision.(4)\u00a0The liquidator shall be entitled to deduct from the collateral or\n\t\t\t\tfrom the deductible reimbursements reasonable and actual expenses incurred in connection with the collection of the collateral and deductible reimbursements under this section.(e)\u00a0(1)\u00a0Regardless of whether there is collateral, if the insolvent insurer has contractually agreed to allow the policyholder to fund its own claims within the deductible amount pursuant to a deductible agreement, either through the policyholder\u2019s own administration of its claims or through its provision of funds directly to a third-party administrator who administers the claims, the liquidator shall allow the funding arrangement to continue and, where applicable, shall enforce the arrangement to the fullest extent possible. The funding of any of these claims by the policyholder within the deductible amount, including, but not limited to, any of these claims by the policyholder or the third-party claimant, shall bar a claim for that amount in the\n\t\t\t\tliquidation proceeding.(2)\u00a0The funding of claims pursuant to paragraph (1) shall extinguish the obligation, if any, of a guaranty association or the California Insurance Guarantee Association to pay the claims within the deductible amount, as well as the obligation, if any, of the policyholder or third-party administrator to reimburse the guaranty association or the California Insurance Guarantee Association. No charge of any kind shall be made by the liquidator against any guaranty association or the California Insurance Guarantee Association on the basis of the policyholder funding of claims payment made pursuant to the mechanism set forth in this subdivision. The funding of these claims by the policyholders shall not limit or prejudice any right the guaranty association or the California Insurance Guarantee Association may have with respect to these claims under state law. Any policyholder that funds its own claims under the provisions of\n\t\t\t\tthis subdivision shall provide to the guaranty association or to the California Insurance Guarantee Association all relevant information concerning the claim whenever the policyholder\u2019s reserved liability for the claim equals or exceeds 50 percent of the deductible amount on the claim.(f)\u00a0(1)\u00a0If the insurer has not contractually agreed to allow the policyholder to fund its own claims within the deductible amount, to the extent a guaranty association or the California Insurance Guarantee Association is required by applicable state law to pay any claims for which the insurer would be or would have been entitled to reimbursement from the policyholder under the terms of the deductible agreement, and to the extent the claims have not been paid by a policyholder or third party, the liquidator shall promptly bill the policyholder for the reimbursement. The policyholder shall pay that amount to the liquidator for the benefit of\n\t\t\t\tthe California Insurance Guarantee Association or the guaranty association that paid the claims. Neither the insolvency of the insurer, nor its inability to perform any of its obligations under the deductible agreement, shall be a defense to the policyholder\u2019s reimbursement obligation under the deductible agreement.(2)\u00a0When the policyholder reimbursements pursuant to paragraph (1) are collected, the liquidator shall promptly reimburse the guaranty association or the California Insurance Guarantee Association for claims paid that were subject to the deductible. If the policyholder fails to pay the amounts due within 60 days after the bill for the reimbursements is due, the liquidator shall use the collateral to the extent necessary to reimburse the guaranty association or the California Insurance Guarantee Association, and, at the same time, may pursue other collections efforts against the policyholder. If more than one guaranty association or\n\t\t\t\tthe California Insurance Guarantee Association has a claim against the same collateral, and the available collateral, after allocation under subdivision (d), along with billing and collection efforts, are together insufficient to pay each guaranty association or the California Insurance Guarantee Association in full, then the liquidator shall prorate payments to each guaranty association or the California Insurance Guarantee Association based upon the relationship the amount of claims each guaranty association or the California Insurance Guarantee Association has paid bears to the total of all claims paid by the guaranty association or the California Insurance Guarantee Association.(g)\u00a0(1)\u00a0With respect to claim payments made by any guaranty association or the California Insurance Guarantee Association, the liquidator shall promptly provide the court, with a copy to the guaranty association or the California Insurance\n\t\t\t\tGuarantee Association, with a complete report of the liquidator\u2019s deductible billing and collection activities, including copies of the policyholder billings when rendered, the reimbursements collected, the available amounts and use of collateral for each policyholder, and any proration of payments when it occurs. If the liquidator fails to make a good faith effort, within 120 days of receiving a claims payment report, to collect reimbursements due from a policyholder under a deductible agreement based on claim payments made by one or more guaranty associations or the California Insurance Guarantee Association, then the guaranty association or the California Insurance Guarantee Association may pursue collection from the policyholders directly on the same basis as the liquidator, and with the same rights and remedies, and shall report any amounts so collected from each policyholder to the liquidator. To the extent that the guaranty association or the California Insurance Guarantee Association pays claims\n\t\t\t\twithin the deductible amount, but is not reimbursed by the liquidator under this section or by policyholder payments from the collection efforts of the guaranty association or the California Insurance Guarantee Association, the guaranty association or the California Insurance Guarantee Association shall have a claim against the insolvent insurer\u2019s estate for the unreimbursed claims payments.(2)\u00a0The liquidator shall periodically adjust the collateral being held as the claims subject to the deductible agreement are satisfied, provided that adequate collateral is maintained to secure the entire estimated ultimate obligation of the policyholder plus a reasonable safety factor, and provided further that the liquidator shall not be required to adjust the collateral more than once a year. The guaranty associations or the California Insurance Guarantee Association shall be informed of any collateral adjustment, including but not limited to, the basis\n\t\t\t\tfor the adjustment. Once all claims covered by the collateral have been paid and the liquidator is satisfied that no new claims can be presented, the liquidator shall release any remaining collateral to the policyholder.(h)\u00a0The court having jurisdiction over the liquidation proceedings shall have jurisdiction to resolve disputes arising under this provision.(i)\u00a0Nothing in this section is intended to limit or adversely affect any right a guaranty association or the California Insurance Guarantee Association may have under applicable state law to obtain reimbursement from certain classes of policyholders for claims payments made by the guaranty association or the California Insurance Guarantee Association under policies of the insolvent insurer, or for related expenses the guaranty association or the California Insurance Guarantee Association incur.(j)\u00a0This section shall apply only with respect to insolvencies occurring on or after January 1, 2006.(l)\u00a0This section shall apply to claims funded by a guaranty association or the California Insurance Guarantee Association in excess of the deductible only if subdivision (e) is applicable.", "104059": "1068 (b)\u00a0In the event of the insolvency of a health care service plan, upon order of the commissioner which shall be issued following his or her receipt of a notice issued by the Director of the Department of Managed Health Care pursuant to Section 1394.7 of the Health and Safety Code, any insurer, nonprofit hospital service plan, and any other entity, other than a health care service plan, responsible for either the payment of benefits for or the provision of hospital, medical, and surgical benefits under a group contract, that participated in the enrollment process with the insolvent health care service plan at the last regular open enrollment period of a group, shall offer enrollees of the group in the insolvent health care service plan a 30-day enrollment period commencing upon the date of insolvency.

The work furlough administrator may operate the work furlough facility or, with the approval of the board of supervisors, administer the work furlough facility pursuant to written contracts with appropriate public or private agencies or private entities. No agency or private entity may operate a work furlough program or facility without a written contract with the work furlough administrator, and no agency or private entity\n\t\t\t\t\t\tentering into a written contract may itself employ any person who is in the work furlough program. The sheriff or director of the county department of corrections, as the case may be, is authorized to transfer custody of prisoners to the work furlough administrator to be confined in a facility for the period during which they are in the work furlough program.(3)\u00a0All privately operated local work furlough facilities and programs shall be under the jurisdiction of, and subject to the terms of a written contract entered into with, the work furlough administrator.

Failure to comply with the appropriate health, safety, and fire laws or minimum jail standards adopted by the board may be cause for termination of the contract. Upon discovery of a failure to comply with these requirements, the work furlough administrator shall notify the privately operated program director that the contract may be canceled if the specified deficiencies are not corrected within 60 days.(4)\u00a0All private work furlough facilities and programs shall be inspected biennially by the Board of State and Community Corrections unless the work furlough administrator requests an earlier inspection pursuant to Section\n\t\t\t\t\t\t6031.1.

The work furlough administrator may, if the administrator concludes that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe person is a fit subject to continue in the person\u2019s job training program, direct that the person be permitted to continue in that job training program, if that is compatible with the requirements of subdivision (c), or may authorize the person to secure local job training for themselves, unless the court at the time of sentencing has ordered that person not be granted work furloughs. The work furlough administrator may, if the administrator concludes that the person is a fit subject to continue in the person\u2019s regular educational program, direct that the person be permitted to continue in that educational program, if that is compatible with the requirements of subdivision (c), or may authorize the person to secure education for themselves, unless the court at the time of sentencing has ordered that person not be granted work furloughs.(c)\u00a0If the work furlough administrator so directs that the prisoner be permitted to continue in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprisoner\u2019s regular employment, job training, or educational program, the administrator shall arrange for a continuation of that employment or for that job training or education, so far as possible without interruption. If the prisoner does not have regular employment or a regular job training or educational program, and the administrator has authorized the prisoner to secure employment, job training, or education for themselves, the prisoner may do so, and the administrator may assist the prisoner in doing so. Any employment, job training, or education so secured shall be suitable for the prisoner. The employment, and the job training or educational program if it includes earnings by the prisoner, shall be at a wage at least as high as the prevailing wage for similar work in the area where the work is performed and in accordance with the prevailing working conditions in that area.

The release shall not be construed as assumption of liability by the county or work furlough administrator for medical treatment obtained.(2)\u00a0The work furlough administrator may release any prisoner classified for the work furlough program for a period not to exceed 72 hours for medical, dental, or psychiatric care, or for family emergencies or pressing business which would result in severe hardship if the release were not granted, or to attend those activities as the administrator deems may effectively promote the prisoner\u2019s successful return to the community, including, but not limited to, an attempt to secure housing, employment, entry into educational programs, or participation in community programs.(e)\u00a0The earnings of the prisoner may be collected by the work furlough administrator, and it shall be the duty of the prisoner\u2019s employer to transmit the wages to the administrator at the latter\u2019s request. Earnings levied upon pursuant to writ of execution or in other lawful manner shall not be transmitted to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tadministrator. If the administrator has requested transmittal of earnings prior to levy, that request shall have priority. In a case in which the functions of the administrator are performed by a sheriff, and the sheriff receives a writ of execution for the earnings of a prisoner subject to this section but has not yet requested transmittal of the prisoner\u2019s earnings pursuant to this section, the sheriff shall first levy on the earnings pursuant to the writ. When an employer or educator transmits earnings to the administrator pursuant to this subdivision, the sheriff shall have no liability to the prisoner for those earnings. From the earnings the administrator shall pay the prisoner\u2019s board and personal expenses, both inside and outside the jail, and shall deduct so much of the costs of administration of this section as is allocable to the prisoner or if the prisoner is unable to pay that sum, a lesser sum as is reasonable, and, in an amount determined by the administrator, shall pay the support of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprisoner\u2019s dependents, if any. If sufficient funds are available after making the foregoing payments, the administrator may, with the consent of the prisoner, pay, in whole or in part, the preexisting debts of the prisoner. Any balance shall be retained until the prisoner\u2019s discharge. Upon discharge the balance shall be paid to the prisoner.(f)\u00a0The prisoner shall be eligible for time credits pursuant to Sections 4018 and 4019.(g)\u00a0If the prisoner violates the conditions laid down for the prisoner\u2019s conduct, custody, job training, education, or employment, the work furlough administrator may order the balance of the prisoner\u2019s sentence to be spent in actual confinement.(h)\u00a0Willful failure of the prisoner to return to the place of confinement not later than the expiration of any period during which the prisoner is\n\t\t\t\t\t\tauthorized to be away from the place of confinement pursuant to this section is punishable as provided in Section 4532.(i)\u00a0The court may recommend or refer a person to the work furlough administrator for consideration for placement in the work furlough program or a particular work furlough facility.

Any additional funding for the employee retention program beyond what was already approved in commission Decision\n\t\t\t\t  18-11-024 shall be submitted by the operator in an application for review by the commission.(3)\u00a0The commission shall determine the amount or allocation that the customers of all load-serving entities subject to the commission\u2019s jurisdiction shall contribute towards the reasonable additional costs of decommissioning planning resulting from the license renewal applications or license renewals and shall authorize the operator to recover in rates those costs through a nonbypassable charge applicable to the customers of all load-serving entities subject to the commission\u2019s jurisdiction in the state as set forth in paragraph (1) of subdivision (l).(4)\u00a0The commission shall authorize the operator to recover in rates all of the reasonable costs incurred to prepare for, respond to, provide information to, or otherwise participate in or engage the independent peer review panel under\n\t\t\t\t  Section 712.(5)\u00a0In lieu of a rate-based return on investment and in acknowledgment of the greater risk of outages in an older plant that the operator could be held liable for, the commission shall authorize the operator to recover in rates a volumetric payment equal to six dollars and fifty cents ($6.50), in 2022 dollars, for each megawatthour generated by the Diablo Canyon powerplant during the period of extended operations beyond the current expiration dates, to be borne by customers of all load-serving entities, and an additional volumetric payment equal to six dollars and fifty cents ($6.50), in 2022 dollars, to be borne by customers in the service territory of the operator. The amount of the operating risk payment shall be adjusted annually by the commission using commission-approved escalation methodologies and adjustment factors.(6)\u00a0(A)\u00a0In lieu of a\n\t\t\t\t  rate-based return on investment and in acknowledgment of the greater risk of outages in an older plant that the operator could be held liable for, the commission shall authorize the operator to recover in rates a fixed payment of fifty million dollars ($50,000,000), in 2022 dollars, for each unit for each year of extended operations, subject to adjustment in subparagraphs (B) to (D), inclusive. The amount of the fixed payment shall be adjusted annually by the commission using commission-approved escalation methodologies and adjustment factors.(B)\u00a0In the first year of extended operations for each unit, the operator shall continue to receive the full fixed payment during periods in which a unit is out of service due to an unplanned outage for nine months or less, and shall receive 50 percent of the payment for months in excess of nine months that a unit is down.(C)\u00a0In the second\n\t\t\t\t  year of extended operations, the operator shall continue to receive the fixed payment during periods in which a unit is out of service due to an unplanned outage for eight months or less, and shall receive 50 percent of the payment for months in excess of eight months that a unit is down.(D)\u00a0In each subsequent year of extended operations, the period in which the full fixed payment is received during periods when a unit is out of service due to an unplanned outage shall decline by one additional month.(g)\u00a0The commission shall authorize and fund as part of the charge under paragraph (1) of subdivision (l), the Diablo Canyon Extended Operations liquidated damages balancing account in the amount of twelve million five hundred thousand dollars ($12,500,000) each month for each unit until the liquidated damages balancing account has a balance of three hundred million dollars\n\t\t\t\t  ($300,000,000).(h)\u00a0(1)\u00a0The commission shall authorize the operator to recover all reasonable costs and expenses necessary to operate Diablo Canyon Units 1 and 2 beyond the current expiration dates, including those in subdivisions (f) and (g), net of market revenues for those operations and any production tax credits of the operator, on a forecast basis in a new proceeding structured similarly to its annual Energy Resource Recovery Account forecast proceeding with a subsequent true-up to actual costs and market revenues for the prior calendar year via an expedited Tier 3 advice letter process, provided that there shall be no further review of the reasonableness of costs incurred if actual costs are below 115 percent of the forecasted costs. All costs shall be recovered as an operating expense and shall not be eligible for inclusion in the operator\u2019s rate base.(2)\u00a0As the result of any significant one-time capital expenditures during the extended operation period, the commission may authorize, and the operator may propose, cost recovery of these expenditures as operating expenses amortized over more than one year for the purpose of reducing rate volatility, at an amortization interest rate determined by the commission. The commission shall allow cost recovery if the costs and expenses are just and reasonable. Those costs and expenses are just and reasonable if the operator\u2019s conduct is consistent with the actions that a reasonable utility would have undertaken in good faith under similar circumstances, at the relevant point in time and with information that the operator should have known at the relevant point in time.(3)\u00a0If, as a result of the annual true-up for extended operations in paragraph (1), the commission determines that market revenues for the prior year exceeded the annual\n\t\t\t\t  costs and expenses, including those in subdivisions (f) and (g), the commission shall direct that any available surplus revenues in an account created under subdivision (e) be credited solely to customers in the operator\u2019s service territory. For customers outside the operator\u2019s service territory, market revenues may be credited up to, but not to exceed, their respective annual costs and expenses. If excess funds remain in an account created under subdivision (e) as a result of market revenues exceeding costs and expenses in the final year of the extended operating period, after truing up the final operating year\u2019s market revenues against costs and expenses, the remaining funds shall be the sole source of loan repayment per the requirements provided under Chapter 6.3 (commencing with Section 25548) of Division 15 of the Public Resources Code, except that any federal funds received as described in paragraph (1) of subdivision (c) of Section 25548.3 of the Public Resources Code shall also be used to repay the\n\t\t\t\t  loan. Ratepayer funds shall not otherwise be used in any manner to repay the loan provided for under Chapter 6.3 (commencing with Section 25548) of Division 15 of the Public Resources Code.(i)\u00a0(1)\u00a0During any unplanned outage periods, the commission shall authorize the operator to recover reasonable replacement power costs, if incurred, associated with Diablo Canyon powerplant operations. If the commission finds that replacement power costs incurred when a unit is out of service due to an unplanned outage are the result of a failure of the operator to meet the reasonable manager standard, then the commission shall authorize payment of the replacement power costs from the Diablo Canyon Extended Operations liquidated damages balancing account described in subdivision (g).(2)\u00a0After commencing payments from the Diablo Canyon Extended Operations liquidated\n\t\t\t\t  damages balancing account under the conditions described in paragraph (1), the commission shall authorize the replenishment of the Diablo Canyon Extended Operations liquidated damages balancing account in the amount of twelve million five hundred thousand dollars ($12,500,000) for each unit for each month up to a maximum account balance of three hundred million dollars ($300,000,000).(j)\u00a0If the commission finds that the operator is requesting recovery of costs that were previously authorized by the commission or other state or federal agency or paid to the operator for cost recovery, the commission may fine the operator an amount up to three times the amount of the penalty provided in Section 2107 for each violation.(k)\u00a0If at any point during the license renewal process or extended operations period the operator believes that, as a result of an unplanned outage, an emergent\n\t\t\t\t  operating risk, or a new compliance requirement, the cost of performing upgrades needed to continue operations of one or both units exceed the benefits to ratepayers of the continued operation of doing so, the operator shall promptly notify the commission. The commission shall promptly review and determine whether expending funds to continue operations is reasonable, will remain beneficial to ratepayers, and is in the public interest or direct the operator to cease operations. The operator shall take all actions necessary to safely operate or maintain the Diablo Canyon powerplant pending the commission determination.(l)\u00a0(1)\u00a0Any costs the commission authorizes the operator to recover in rates under this section shall be recovered on a fully nonbypassable basis from customers of all load-serving entities subject to the commissions\u2019s jurisdiction, as determined by the commission, except as otherwise provided in this\n\t\t\t\t  section. The recovery of these nonbypassable costs by the load-serving entities shall be based on each customer\u2019s gross consumption of electricity regardless of a customer\u2019s net metering status or purchase of electric energy and service from an electric service provider, community choice aggregator, or other third-party source of electric energy or electricity service.(2)\u00a0The commission shall establish mechanisms, including authorizing balancing and memorandum accounts and, as needed, agreements with, or orders with respect to, electrical corporations, community choice aggregators, and electric service providers, to ensure that the revenues received to pay a charge or cost payable pursuant to this section are recovered in rates from those entities and promptly remitted to the entity entitled to those revenues.(m)\u00a0This section does not alter the recovery of costs, including those\n\t\t\t\t  previously approved by the commission, to operate Diablo Canyon Units 1 and 2 until the current expiration dates.(n)\u00a0The commission shall halt disbursements from the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Decommissioning Non-Qualified Trust, excluding refunds to ratepayers.(o)\u00a0The commission, in consultation with the relevant federal and state agencies and appropriate California Native American tribes, shall, in a new or existing proceeding, determine the disposition of the Diablo Canyon powerplant real property and its surrounding real properties owned by the applicable public utility or any legally related, affiliated, or associated companies, in a manner that best serves the interests of the local community, ratepayers, California Native America tribes, and the state. It is the intent of the Legislature that the existing efforts to transfer lands owned by the operator and Eureka Energy shall\n\t\t\t\t  not be impeded by the extension of the Diablo Canyon powerplant.(p)\u00a0Except as otherwise provided in this section, this section does not alter or limit any proceeding of the commission relating to the decommissioning of the Diablo Canyon powerplant.(q)\u00a0The Legislature finds and declares that the purpose of the extension of the Diablo Canyon powerplant operations is to protect the state against significant uncertainty in future demand resulting from the state\u2019s greenhouse gas reduction efforts involving electrification of transportation and building energy end uses and regional climate-related weather phenomenon, and to address the risk that currently ordered procurement will be insufficient to meet this supply or that there may be delays in bringing the ordered resources online on schedule. Consequently, the continued operation of Diablo Canyon Units 1 and 2 beyond their current\n\t\t\t\t  expiration dates shall not be factored into the analyses used by the commission or by load-serving entities not subject to the commission\u2019s jurisdiction when determining future generation and transmission needs to ensure electrical grid reliability and to meet the state\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals. To the extent the commission decides to allocate any benefits or attributes from extended operations of the Diablo Canyon powerplant, the commission may consider the higher cost to customers in the operator\u2019s service area.(r)\u00a0Any sale, mortgage, transfer of operational control, or any other encumbrance of disposition of the Diablo Canyon powerplant shall continue to be subject to Article 6 (commencing with Section 851).(s)\u00a0(1)\u00a0The operator shall submit to the commission for its review, on an annual basis the amount of compensation earned under\n\t\t\t\t  paragraph (5) of subdivision (f), how it was spent, and a plan for prioritizing the uses of such compensation the next year. Such compensation shall not be paid out to shareholders.

Safe and reliable electric and gas utility service is vital to public health, public safety, air quality, and\n\t\t\t\t  reducing emissions of greenhouse gases.(3)\u00a0Changes in the ownership or control of an electrical corporation or gas corporation may create uncertainty regarding the safe, efficient, and continuous provision of safe and reliable electrical and gas service to California consumers, leading to economic instability.(4)\u00a0Mass displacement of electrical corporation or gas corporation workers as a result of a change in the ownership or control of an electrical corporation or gas corporation causes excessive reliance on the unemployment insurance system, and public social services and health programs, increasing costs to these vital governmental programs and placing a significant burden on the state and California taxpayers.(5)\u00a0The state has a compelling interest in ensuring that when there is a change in the ownership or\n\t\t\t\t  control of an electrical corporation or gas corporation, the new employer maintains a qualified and knowledgeable workforce with the ability to ensure safe, efficient, reliable, and continuous service to California consumers and communities.(6)\u00a0Because of destructive and deadly wildfires and gas pipeline explosions, the electric and gas industries are in an unprecedented state of instability. One combined electrical and gas corporation has sought bankruptcy protection. All the major electrical corporations have had their credit ratings lowered to junk bond status or are at risk of downgrades to junk bond status. This jeopardizes the ability of these corporations to provide safe and reliable electric and gas service, to reduce the risk of future catastrophes, to provide service at just and reasonable rates, to meet the state\u2019s mandates to reduce carbon emissions, and to address the risks of climate change.(7)\u00a0There is a nationwide shortage of the qualified utility line workers and qualified line clearance tree trimmers needed to prevent and respond to wildfires, storms, and other major events. Because this work is performed on and near high voltage lines and other energized electrical equipment, these jobs require substantial training and are highly dangerous. Current efforts to hire enough qualified people to perform these functions have fallen short even though exceptional compensation packages are being offered. Any reduction in the number or qualifications of these employees would increase the risk to employees and the risk of future catastrophic wildfires, and would increase the frequency and duration of outages, particularly as a result of more common and more severe major storms. It is in the interest of the state and its citizens that utilities have the qualified workforce necessary to minimize the risk of future wildfires, to minimize\n\t\t\t\t  future outages, and to restore service as promptly as possible after storms.(8)\u00a0For the reasons provided in this subdivision, the Legislature must take action to stabilize the utility workforce so as to preserve the ability of utilities to provide safe and reliable electric and gas service. This requires that the size of the workforce be preserved or increased, and workers not be lost to other utilities offering more stable employment or better compensation.(c)\u00a0(1)\u00a0Except as otherwise provided in this section, a successor employer shall retain all covered employees for at least the transition period following a change of control, unless the commission approves a reduction in the workforce pursuant to subdivision (i).

The successor employer may reduce the wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment or the total number of employees in a manner inconsistent with collective bargaining agreements only if authorized by the commission in a final, nonappealable decision. The commission shall not provide this authorization except on proof by a preponderance of the evidence in an application proceeding of all of the following:(1)\u00a0Neither the nature nor scope of the work performed by those employees proposed to be eliminated is necessary to providing safe and reliable utility service.

Notwithstanding Section 13340 of the Government Code, all amounts deposited in the California Tobacco Directory Fund are hereby continuously appropriated without regard to fiscal year to the Office of the Attorney General for the purpose of administering the Directory.

Each tobacco product manufacturer shall provide to each distributor to whom it sells or ships cigarettes a copy of each acknowledgment of receipt provided to the tobacco\n\t\t\t\t  product manufacturer by the Attorney General. Upon request, the Attorney General shall provide any distributor with a copy of the most recent written acknowledgment of receipt provided to the tobacco product manufacturer.(d)\u00a0(1)\u00a0The Attorney General may exclude or remove from the Directory a tobacco product manufacturer or any of its brand families, based on a determination that the manufacturer is not a participating manufacturer that has provided the required certification and made all payments calculated by the independent auditor to be due from it under the MSA, except to the extent that it is disputing the payment, or in the case of a nonparticipating manufacturer, has not made all escrow payments required by paragraph (2) of subdivision (a) of Section 104557 of the Health and Safety Code, in accordance with that subdivision, or has not complied with this section or Section 30165.2, or the tobacco product\n\t\t\t\t  manufacturer has not complied with any state or federal delivery sales laws applicable to sales and distribution of tobacco products in this state. Before the exclusion or removal may take effect, the Attorney General shall notify the tobacco product manufacturer of this determination.(2)\u00a0Upon receiving notice from the Attorney General pursuant to paragraph (1), the tobacco product manufacturer may challenge the Attorney General\u2019s determination as erroneous, and may seek relief from the determination, by filing a petition for writ of mandate pursuant to Section 1085 of the Code of Civil Procedure for that purpose in the Superior Court for the County of Sacramento, or as otherwise provided by law. The filing of the petition shall operate to stay the Attorney General\u2019s determination, if the participating manufacturer has made all payments calculated by the independent auditor to be due from it under the MSA, except to the extent that it is\n\t\t\t\t  disputing payment, or if a nonparticipating manufacturer has paid into escrow the full amount of any deficiency in the escrow payments that the Attorney General has determined the nonparticipating manufacturer was required to have made under paragraph (2) of subdivision (a) of Section 104557 of the Health and Safety Code, including any installment payments required under subdivision (h), pending final resolution of the action.(e)\u00a0(1)\u00a0No person shall affix, or cause to be affixed, any tax stamp or meter impression to a package of cigarettes pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 30163, or pay the tax levied pursuant to Sections 30123 and 30131.2 on a tobacco product defined as a cigarette under this section, unless the brand family and brand style of the cigarettes or tobacco product, and the tobacco product manufacturer that makes or sells the cigarettes, are included on the Directory.(2)\u00a0No person shall sell, offer, or possess for sale in this state, ship or otherwise distribute into or within this state or import for personal consumption in this state, cigarettes of a tobacco product manufacturer, brand family, or brand style not included in the Directory.(3)\u00a0No person shall do either of the following:(A)\u00a0Sell or distribute cigarettes that the person knows or should know are intended to be distributed in violation of paragraphs (1) and (2).(B)\u00a0Acquire, hold, own, possess, transport, import, or cause to be imported cigarettes that the person knows or should know are intended to be distributed in violation of paragraphs (1) and (2).(f)\u00a0(1)\u00a0A\n\t\t\t\t  nonresident or foreign nonparticipating manufacturer that has not registered to do business in the state as a foreign corporation or business entity shall, as a condition precedent to having its brand families or brand styles listed or retained in the Directory, appoint and continually engage without interruption the services of an agent in this state to act as agent for the service of process on whom all process, and any action or proceeding against the nonresident or foreign nonparticipating manufacturer concerning or arising out of the enforcement of this section, Article 3 (commencing with Section 104555) of Chapter 1 of Part 3 of Division 103 of the Health and Safety Code, and any regulations adopted pursuant to those provisions, may be served in any manner authorized by law. This service shall constitute legal and valid service of process on the nonparticipating manufacturer. The nonparticipating manufacturer shall provide the name, address, telephone number, and proof of the appointment and\n\t\t\t\t  availability of the agent to the satisfaction of the Attorney General. A nonparticipating manufacturer located outside of the United States shall, as an additional condition precedent to having its brand families listed or retained in the Directory, cause each of its importers into the United States of any of its brand families to be sold in the state to appoint and continually engage without interruption the services of an agent in the state in accordance with this section. All obligations of a nonparticipating manufacturer imposed by this section with respect to appointment of its agent shall likewise apply to importers with respect to appointment of their agents.(2)\u00a0The nonparticipating manufacturer shall provide notice to the Attorney General 30 calendar days before termination of the authority of an agent and shall further provide proof to the satisfaction of the Attorney General of the appointment of a new agent no less than five\n\t\t\t\t  calendar days before the termination of an existing agent appointment. In the event an agent terminates an agency appointment, the nonparticipating manufacturer shall notify the Attorney General of said termination within five calendar days and shall include proof to the satisfaction of the Attorney General of the appointment of a new agent.(3)\u00a0(A)\u00a0A nonparticipating manufacturer whose products are sold in this state without appointing or designating an agent as herein required shall be deemed to have appointed the Secretary of State as its agent. The appointment of the Secretary of State as the agent for service of process pursuant to this provision does not satisfy the condition precedent specified in paragraph (1) to having its brand families listed or retained in the Directory.(B)\u00a0The Attorney General or their authorized representative may proceed\n\t\t\t\t  against a nonparticipating manufacturer in the courts of this state pursuant to subparagraph (A) by service of process upon the Secretary of State. The service may be made by delivering by hand to the Secretary of State or their authorized representative one copy of the process for each defendant to be served, together with a declaration stating that service is being made upon the Secretary of State pursuant to subparagraph (A), setting forth the last known address of the nonparticipating manufacturer, and signed by the party to the action seeking service.(C)\u00a0Upon receipt of the records described in subparagraph (B), the Secretary of State or their authorized representative shall give notice of the service of process to any nonparticipating manufacturer served by forwarding a copy of the process to the nonparticipating manufacturer at the last known address identified in the declaration.(4)\u00a0For each nonparticipating manufacturer located outside the United States, each importer into the United States of any nonparticipating manufacturer\u2019s brand families that are sold in the state shall bear joint and several liability with the nonparticipating manufacturer for deposit of all escrow due under, and payment of all costs and attorney\u2019s fees imposed in accordance with, Section 104557 of the Health and Safety Code, and payment of all fees, costs, attorney\u2019s fees, penalties, and refunds imposed or required by this section or Section 30165.2. Each tobacco product manufacturer and importer, that sells or intends to sell cigarettes in California, shall obtain and maintain a license as a manufacturer or importer in compliance with Division 8.6 (commencing with Section 22970) of the Business and Professions Code. Each nonparticipating manufacturer and its importers shall report in the manner, including electronically, as required by the Attorney General, all cigarettes sold in this state\n\t\t\t\t  each month, including, but not limited to, the quantity, including tobacco weight and number of cigarettes, the wholesale cost, and sale price of each brand family and brand style.

The data requested by the department in the survey may include, among other things, information regarding the manner in which payments made to hospitals under this section were reported by the hospitals to the Office\n\t\t\t\t  of Statewide Health Planning and Development. The data requested may also include information regarding the manner in which hospitals reported figures relating to charity care, bad debts, and amounts received in connection with state or local indigent care programs.(iii)\u00a0In connection with any survey conducted under clause (ii), the department may require that hospitals submit responses in accordance with a deadline established by the department, and that the responses be supported by a verification of a hospital representative. Should any hospital not respond on a timely basis in accordance with protocols established by the department, the department shall utilize prior year data, adjusted by the department in its discretion, to calculate the hospital\u2019s low-income utilization rate.(G)\u00a0Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all payment adjustment amounts, including per diem\n\t\t\t\t  payment adjustment amounts and supplemental lump-sum payment adjustments, paid or payable to a hospital under this section, shall be recorded on an accrual basis of accounting in reports filed by the hospital with the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development or the department.(5)\u00a0For purposes of payment adjustment amounts under this section, each disproportionate share list shall be considered complete when issued by the department pursuant to paragraph (1).

Additionally, the department may consider the days of service provided by the qualifying hospitals for Medi-Cal patients covered by\n\t\t\t\t  the prepaid health plans contracting directly with the Medi-Cal program in achieving their maximum payments in those payment years.(D)\u00a0In order to meet the requirements of subparagraph (C), the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development shall provide to the department quarterly access to all data elements on the edited and unedited confidential patient discharge data files, including Social Security account numbers. The department shall match these data with the department\u2019s Medi-Cal Eligibility Data System files to extract any data necessary to meet the requirements of subparagraph (C). The department shall maintain the confidentiality of all patient discharge data to the same extent as is required of the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development.(2)\u00a0Notwithstanding paragraph (1), there shall be, for each eligible hospital, a maximum limit on the number of\n\t\t\t\t  Medi-Cal acute inpatient hospital days for which payment adjustment amounts may be paid under this section with respect to each payment adjustment year. The maximum limit shall be that number of days that equals 80 percent of the eligible hospital\u2019s annualized Medi-Cal inpatient paid days, as determined from all Medi-Cal paid claims records available through April 1 preceding the beginning of the payment adjustment year.(m)\u00a0No payment rate for any service rendered by any hospital under the Medi-Cal selective provider contracting program shall be reduced as a result of this section. (n)\u00a0Notwithstanding any other provision of law, to the extent consistent with federal law, and except as provided by this section, no maximum payment limit shall be placed on the amount of Medi-Cal payment adjustments which may be made to disproportionate share hospitals. The payments made to\n\t\t\t\t  disproportionate share hospitals pursuant to this section and Section 14105.99 shall not cause any other amounts paid or payable to a hospital to be deemed in excess of any applicable maximum payment limit.(o)\u00a0The department shall promptly seek any necessary federal approvals in order to implement this section, including any amendments. Pursuant to Section 1396r-4 of Title 42 of the United States Code, and related federal medicaid statutes and regulations, payment adjustment systems for inpatient hospital services rendered by disproportionate share hospitals shall be included in a state\u2019s medicaid plan. Therefore, the department shall, prior to the end of the calendar quarter during which this section is enacted or amended, submit for federal approval an amendment to the Medi-Cal State Plan in connection with the payment adjustment program.(p)\u00a0(1)\u00a0The\n\t\t\t\t  department shall compute, prior to the beginning of each payment adjustment year, the projected size of the payment adjustment program for the particular payment adjustment year. To do so, the department shall determine the projected total payment adjustment amount for each eligible hospital, and shall add these amounts together to determine the projected total size of the program. To the extent this projected total figure for the program exceeds the portion of the maximum state disproportionate share hospital allotment for California under federal law that the department anticipates will be available for the period in question, the department shall reduce the total per diem composite amounts of the various eligible hospitals in the fashion described below so that the allotment in question will not be exceeded.(2)\u00a0As an initial step, all total per diem composite amounts for the entire payment adjustment year shall be reduced proportionately\n\t\t\t\t  not to exceed 2 percent of each total per diem composite amount.(3)\u00a0If the reductions authorized by paragraph (2) are insufficient to align the program with the federal allotment for California, then, to the extent permitted by federal law, the following shall apply:(A)\u00a0The adjusted total per diem composite amounts, as calculated under paragraph (2), shall remain in effect for each eligible hospital whose low-income number is 30 percent or more.(B)\u00a0The adjusted total per diem composite amounts, as calculated under paragraph (2), for all other eligible hospitals shall be further reduced proportionately to align the program with the federal allotment, but in no event to a level that is less than 65 percent of the total per diem composite amount that would have been payable to the eligible hospital had no reductions\n\t\t\t\t  taken place.(4)\u00a0If the steps set forth in paragraph (3) are not permissible under federal law, or are not adequate to align the program with the federal allotment, the adjusted total per diem composite amounts for all eligible hospitals for the entire payment adjustment year shall be further reduced proportionately to align the program with the federal allotment, but in no event to a level that would result in adjusted total per diem composite amounts that are less than 65 percent of the total per diem composite amounts that would have been payable had no reductions taken place.(5)\u00a0When all eligible hospitals have been reduced to the 65-percent level set forth in paragraphs (3) and (4), the adjusted total per diem composite amounts for all eligible hospitals shall be further reduced proportionately as necessary to align the program with the federal allotment.(6)\u00a0This subdivision shall not apply to the 1995\u201396 payment adjustment year.(q)\u00a0(1)\u00a0If it is necessary to apply the provisions of paragraph (3) of subdivision (p) at any time, the department shall, as soon as practicable, evaluate why the insufficiency arose and identify the projected occurrence and duration of any future insufficiencies.(2)\u00a0If the department determines as a result of the evaluations under paragraph (1) that (A) implementation of paragraph (3) of subdivision (p) will likely be necessary to resolve additional insufficiencies for the current payment adjustment year or the next payment adjustment year; and (B) that the level of federal financial participation realized by the payment adjustment program, for the current payment adjustment year as a whole, will be less than 30 percent\n\t\t\t\t  of the percentage of federal financial participation that normally is applicable for Medi-Cal expenditures for acute inpatient hospital services, and that the level of federal financial participation for the payment adjustment program is expected to continue to remain below that 30-percent level for the next payment adjustment year as a whole, the department shall, as soon as practicable, implement paragraphs (3) and (4). (3)\u00a0If the department determines that the circumstances described in paragraph (2) are present, the payment adjustment program shall be terminated, effective as of the earliest date permissible under federal law. In that event, all installment payments to the fund which are already due pursuant to Section 14163 at the time of the department\u2019s determination shall remain due, and shall be collected by the Controller. However, installment payments which are not yet due at that time shall not become due. (4)\u00a0Within 90 days after the termination of the payment adjustment program, as referred to in paragraph (3), or as soon as practicable, the department shall determine whether any amounts remain in the fund that are not needed to pay prior payment adjustment amounts under this section. If remaining amounts exist in the fund, they shall be refunded to transferor entities on a pro rata basis, within 45 days after the date of the department\u2019s determination.(r)\u00a0(1)\u00a0The state shall be held harmless from any federal disallowance resulting from payments made under this section, and from payments made to hospitals based on transfers accepted by the department under Section 14164. Any hospital that has received payments under this section, or based on transfers accepted by the department under Section 14164, shall be liable for any audit exception or federal disallowance\n\t\t\t\t  only with respect to the payments made to that hospital. The department shall recoup from a hospital the amount of any audit exception or federal disallowance in the manner authorized by applicable laws and regulations.(2)\u00a0Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, if any payment adjustment that has been paid, or that otherwise would have been payable to an eligible hospital under this section, exceeds the OBRA 1993 payment limitation for the particular hospital, the department shall withhold or recoup the payment adjustment amount that exceeds the limitation. The nonfederal component of the amount withheld or recouped shall be redeposited in, or shall remain in, the fund, as applicable, until used for the purposes described in paragraph (2) of subdivision (j) of Section 14163.(s)\u00a0(1)\u00a0The department may utilize existing administrative appeal procedures\n\t\t\t\t  for purposes of any appealable matter that arises under the payment adjustment program. The matters that may be appealed shall be limited to those related to the following:(A)\u00a0Paragraph (5) of subdivision (f). (B)\u00a0State audit disallowances of amounts paid to hospitals under the payment adjustment program. (2)\u00a0Calculations which are final pursuant to paragraph (4) or (5) of subdivision (f) or the procedures or data on which those calculations are based, shall not be appealed.(t)\u00a0(1)\u00a0Except as provided in paragraph (2), the department shall take all appropriate steps permitted by law and the Medi-Cal State Plan to ensure the following for all years of the payment adjustment program:(A)\u00a0That well-baby (nursery) days and acute administrative days are included in the payment adjustment program in the same fashion as all other Medi-Cal days of acute inpatient hospital service.(B)\u00a0That, to the same extent as any other Medi-Cal days of acute inpatient hospital service, well-baby (nursery) days and acute administrative days are included as payable days under the payment adjustment program and in the total of annualized Medi-Cal inpatient paid days.(C)\u00a0That, if pursuant to paragraph (2), any well-baby (nursery) days or acute administrative days are not included in the payment adjustment program for payment purposes for any parts of the 1992\u201393 or 1993\u201394 payment adjustment years, all those days are nevertheless included in the total of annualized Medi-Cal inpatient paid days for all purposes under the\n\t\t\t\t  payment adjustment program, unless otherwise barred by paragraph (2).(2)\u00a0In no event shall paragraph (1) be implemented in a fashion that is inconsistent with federal medicaid law or the Medi-Cal State Plan.(u)\u00a0(1)\u00a0For the 1993\u201394 payment adjustment year, each eligible hospital shall also be eligible to receive a supplemental lump-sum payment adjustment, which shall be payable as a result of the hospital being included on the disproportionate share list as of September 30, 1993. For purposes of federal medicaid rules, including Section 447.297(d) of Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations, the supplemental payment adjustments shall be applicable to the federal fiscal year that ends on September 30, 1993.(2)\u00a0The availability of supplemental payment adjustments under this subdivision shall\n\t\t\t\t  be determined as follows:(A)\u00a0The final maximum state disproportionate share hospital allotment for California under the provisions of applicable federal medicaid rules shall be identified for the 1993 federal fiscal year. This final allotment is two billion one hundred ninety-one million four hundred fifty-one thousand dollars ($2,191,451,000), as specified at page 43186 of Volume 58 of the Federal Register.(B)\u00a0The total amount of all per diem payment adjustment amounts under this section, whether paid or payable, that are applicable to the 1993 federal fiscal year shall be determined. The applicability of the per diem payment adjustment amounts to the 1993 federal fiscal year shall be determined in accordance with federal medicaid rules, including Sections 447.297(d)(3) and 447.298 of Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations.(C)\u00a0The figure determined under subparagraph (B) shall be subtracted from the figure identified under subparagraph (A). If the remainder is a positive figure, supplemental lump-sum payment adjustments shall be made under this subdivision in accordance with paragraph (3).(3)\u00a0The amount of the supplemental lump-sum payment adjustment to each eligible hospital shall be computed as follows:(A)\u00a0The projected total of all per diem payment adjustment amounts payable to each particular eligible hospital under this section for the 1993\u201394 payment adjustment year shall be determined. For each hospital, this figure shall be identical to the figure used for the same hospital in the calculations regarding transfer amounts under subdivision (h) of Section 14163 for the 1993\u201394 state fiscal year.(B)\u00a0The projected totals for all eligible hospitals determined under subparagraph (A) shall be added together to determine an aggregate total of all projected per diem payment adjustments for the 1993\u201394 payment adjustment year. This figure shall be identical to the aggregate figure for all hospitals used in the calculations regarding transfer amounts under subdivision (h) of Section 14163 for the 1993\u201394 state fiscal year.(C)\u00a0The figure determined for each eligible hospital under subparagraph (A) shall be divided by the aggregate figure determined under subparagraph (B), yielding a percentage figure for each hospital.(D)\u00a0The percentage figure determined for each hospital under subparagraph (C) shall be multiplied by the positive remainder calculated under subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2).(E)\u00a0The product as so determined for each eligible hospital under subparagraph (D) shall be the supplemental lump-sum payment adjustment amount payable to the particular hospital.(4)\u00a0The department shall make partial payments of the supplemental lump-sum payment adjustments to eligible hospitals on or before January 1, 1994. The department shall make final calculations regarding the supplemental lump-sum payments based on data available as of March 1, 1994, and shall distribute the final payments promptly thereafter.(5)\u00a0The department shall implement this subdivision only to the extent consistent with federal medicaid law and the Medi-Cal State Plan, and only to the extent that the department determines that federal financial participation is available. In doing so, the department shall comply with any procedures\n\t\t\t\t  instituted by the Health Care Financing Administration in connection with Sections 447.297(d)(3) and 447.298 of Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations.(v)\u00a0(1)\u00a0For the 1993\u201394 payment adjustment year, each eligible hospital that remains in operation as of June 30, 1994, shall also be eligible to receive a supplemental lump-sum payment adjustment, which shall be payable as a result of the hospital being a disproportionate share hospital in operation as of that date.(2)\u00a0The availability of supplemental lump-sum payment adjustments under this subdivision shall be determined by the department as follows:(A)\u00a0The final maximum state disproportionate share hospital allotment for California under the provisions of applicable federal medicaid rules shall be identified for the 1994 federal fiscal\n\t\t\t\t  year. This final allotment is two billion one hundred ninety-one million four hundred fifty-one thousand dollars ($2,191,451,000), as specified on page 22676 of Volume 59 of the Federal Register.(B)\u00a0The total amount of all per diem payment adjustment amounts under this section, whether paid or payable, that are applicable to the period October 1, 1993, through June 30, 1994, shall be determined.

The total of those two amounts shall be the unadjusted tentative size of the payment adjustment program for the 1995\u201396 payment adjustment year.(6)\u00a0The total per diem composite amount computed for each eligible hospital under subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1) shall be modified as follows:(A)\u00a0The department shall reduce the total per diem composite amount for each eligible hospital by multiplying the amount by an identical percentage. The percentage figure to be used for this purpose shall be that percentage that is derived by dividing the amount determined under paragraph (5) by the unadjusted projected total payment adjustment program amount determined under subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1).(B)\u00a0The percentage\n\t\t\t\t  figure derived under subparagraph (A) shall be applied to the total per diem composite amount for each eligible hospital, yielding an adjusted total per diem composite amount for each hospital for the 1995\u201396 payment adjustment year.(C)\u00a0(i)\u00a0The adjusted total per diem composite amount determined under subparagraph (B) for each eligible hospital shall be multiplied by 80 percent of the hospital\u2019s annualized Medi-Cal inpatient paid days.(ii)\u00a0The amount computed for each hospital under clause (i) shall be compared to the OBRA 1993 payment limitation that, in accordance with applicable provisions of the Medi-Cal State Plan, the department has computed for the particular hospital.(iii)\u00a0Where the amount computed under clause (i) for the particular hospital is less than the OBRA 1993 payment\n\t\t\t\t  limitation for the hospital, the amount computed under clause (i) shall be used for purposes of clause (v).(iv)\u00a0Where the amount computed under clause (i) for the particular hospital exceeds the OBRA 1993 payment limitation for the hospital, the amount computed under clause (i) shall be reduced to an amount equal to the OBRA 1993 payment limitation for the particular hospital.

The availability of supplemental lump-sum payment adjustments under this paragraph shall be determined by the department as follows:(A)\u00a0The adjusted projected total payment adjustment amount for each\n\t\t\t\t  hospital, as determined under subparagraph (C) of paragraph (6), shall be identified.(B)\u00a0The total amount of all per diem payment adjustment amounts under this section, whether paid or payable, that are applicable to the period July 1, 1995, through June 30, 1996, shall be determined for each hospital, taking into account subparagraph (A) of paragraph (7). The applicability of the per diem payment adjustment amounts to this period of time shall be determined in accordance with federal medicaid rules, including Sections 447.297(d)(3) and 447.298 of Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations.(C)\u00a0The amount determined under subparagraph (B) for each hospital shall be subtracted from the amount identified under subparagraph (A) for each hospital. If the remainder is a positive figure for the particular hospital, the supplemental lump-sum payment adjustment for the hospital shall be\n\t\t\t\t  the positive remainder amount, which shall be payable because the facility is a disproportionate share hospital in operation as of June 30, 1996.(D)\u00a0The department shall make interim and final payments of the supplemental lump-sum payment adjustments under this paragraph on or before September 30, 1996.(9)\u00a0Except as provided in subparagraph (C), for the 1995\u201396 payment adjustment year each eligible hospital that remains in operation as of June 30, 1996, shall also be eligible to receive a secondary supplemental payment adjustment, which shall be payable as a result of the facility being a disproportionate share hospital in operation as of that date. The availability of secondary supplemental payment adjustments under this paragraph shall be determined by the department as follows:(A)\u00a0The maximum amount of\n\t\t\t\t  secondary supplemental payment adjustments available pursuant to this paragraph shall be calculated as follows:(i)\u00a0The total amount of all per diem payment adjustment amounts, whether paid or payable, for the 1995\u201396 payment adjustment year, as determined under subparagraph (B) of paragraph (8), shall be identified.(ii)\u00a0The total amount of all supplemental lump-sum payment adjustments, whether paid or payable, as determined under subparagraph (C) of paragraph (8), shall be identified.(iii)\u00a0The department shall estimate the total amount of payment adjustments under this section that it anticipates will be applicable to the period July 1, 1996, through September 30, 1996. The applicability of the payment adjustment amounts to this period of time shall be determined in accordance with federal medicaid rules,\n\t\t\t\t  including Sections 447.297(d)(3) and 447.298 of Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations.(iv)\u00a0The department shall identify the amount of the final maximum state disproportionate share hospital allotment for California for the 1996 federal fiscal year under applicable federal rules. The amount identified shall not exceed two billion one hundred ninety-one million four hundred fifty-one thousand dollars ($2,191,451,000).(v)\u00a0The amounts identified or estimated under clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) shall be added together, and the sum of these amounts shall be subtracted from the amount identified under clause (iv). The remainder determined from this calculation, or the amount of two hundred million dollars ($200,000,000), whichever is less, shall be the maximum amount available for secondary supplemental payment adjustments under this paragraph.(B)\u00a0The maximum amount available for secondary supplemental payment adjustments, as identified under clause (v) of subparagraph (A), shall be distributed to eligible hospitals as follows:(i)\u00a0The total amount of all per diem payment adjustments and supplemental lump-sum payment adjustments relating to the 1995\u201396 payment adjustment year, whether paid or payable, shall be identified for each eligible hospital. However, notwithstanding any other provision of law, those hospitals referred to in subparagraph (C) shall not be included in this step, and shall not receive any secondary supplemental payment adjustments, as described in subparagraph (C).(ii)\u00a0For purposes of secondary supplemental payment adjustments, the eligible hospitals shall be classified into various groups. No hospital may qualify for more than one of\n\t\t\t\t  these groups. Notwithstanding subclause (II), the hospitals described in subparagraph (C) shall not be included in any of these groups. The following groups of hospitals shall be recognized:(I)\u00a0\u201cState of California hospitals,\u201d which shall include all eligible hospitals that, as of July 1, 1995, were licensed to the State of California or to the University of California.(II)\u00a0\u201cCounty hospitals,\u201d which shall include all eligible hospitals that, as of July 1, 1995, were licensed to a county or a city and county, but shall exclude those hospitals referred to in subparagraph (C).(III)\u00a0\u201cOther public hospitals,\u201d which shall include all eligible hospitals that, as of July 1, 1995, were licensed to a local hospital district, a local health authority, a city, or any other noncounty political subdivision of the state.(IV)\u00a0\u201cChildren\u2019s hospitals,\u201d which shall include all eligible hospitals that, as of July 1, 1995, were included in the children\u2019s hospital group under subdivision (h).(V)\u00a0\u201cOther nonpublic hospitals,\u201d which shall include all eligible hospitals that are not included in any group described in subclauses (I) through (IV).(iii)\u00a0The amount determined to be the maximum amount of secondary supplemental payment adjustments under clause (v) of subparagraph (A) shall first be allocated among the groups of hospitals referred to in clause (ii), as follows:(I)\u00a0\u201cState of California hospitals\u201d: 64.35 percent of the maximum amount.(II)\u00a0\u201cCounty hospitals\u201d: 18.095 percent of the maximum amount.(III)\u00a0\u201cOther public hospitals\u201d: 0.65 percent of the maximum amount.(IV)\u00a0\u201cChildren\u2019s hospitals\u201d: 6.755 percent of the maximum amount.(V)\u00a0\u201cOther nonpublic hospitals\u201d: 10.15 percent of the maximum amount.(iv)\u00a0(I)\u00a0The amount of funds allocated pursuant to clause (iii) to each of the particular groups of hospitals referred to in clauses (ii) and (iii) shall then be distributed as secondary supplemental payment adjustments among the eligible hospitals within each particular group. The secondary supplemental distributions shall be made on a descending pro rata basis within each group. Each cycle of the descending pro rata distribution shall be considered to be a phase of the process. As described in subclauses (II) to (V), inclusive, in\n\t\t\t\t  each phase of the descending pro rata distribution, the pro rata share of the distribution to each hospital that remains eligible to receive additional distributions shall be computed based on the ratio of the total payment adjustments that the particular hospital has already earned under the payment adjustment program for the 1995\u201396 payment adjustment year, as compared to the total payment adjustments already earned by the other hospitals in the particular group that remain eligible to receive the additional distributions.(II)\u00a0For the first phase, the total amount of payment adjustments under this section for the 1995\u201396 payment adjustment year, including all per diem payment adjustments and all supplemental lump-sum payment adjustments, that are determined by the department as already being paid or payable to each hospital eligible for the distribution shall be determined.(III)\u00a0The figures determined under subclause (II) for each hospital in the particular group shall be added together to determine an aggregate total.(IV)\u00a0The figures determined for each hospital under subclause (II) shall be divided by the aggregate total determined under subclause (III), yielding a percentage figure for each hospital.(V)\u00a0The percentage figure determined for each hospital under subclause (IV) shall be applied to the maximum portion of the funds allocated to the particular group under clause (iii) that can be distributed in the particular phase until a hospital in the particular group reaches the limitation set forth in clause (v).(v)\u00a0For each hospital, no secondary supplemental payment adjustment shall be paid to the extent that either of the following conditions exist:(I)\u00a0The secondary supplemental payment adjustment would cause the total of all payment adjustments to the hospital under this section relating to the 1995\u201396 payment adjustment year to exceed the amount that is the product of multiplying 0.95 times the particular hospital\u2019s OBRA 1993 payment limitation for the 1995\u201396 payment adjustment year, as computed by the department in accordance with applicable provisions of the Medi-Cal State Plan.(II)\u00a0Without regard to any secondary supplemental payment adjustment, the hospital has already received or has earned payment adjustments relating to the 1995\u201396 payment adjustment year that equal or exceed the product referred to in subclause (I).(vi)\u00a0Any secondary supplemental payment adjustment amount, or portion thereof, that otherwise would have been payable to a particular\n\t\t\t\t  hospital under this paragraph, but that is barred by the limitation described in clause (v), shall be distributed by the department through additional phases of the descending pro rata distribution process to those hospitals within the same group, as set forth in clauses (ii) and (iii), as the particular hospital. For each additional phase, the mathematical steps referred to in subclauses (II) to (V), inclusive, of clause (iv) shall be repeated for those hospitals that have not reached the limitation set forth in clause (v). The phases shall continue until the funds allocated to the particular group under clause (iii) have been fully exhausted. No such distribution, however, shall be in an amount that would cause any hospital to exceed the limitation set forth in clause (v).(C)\u00a0Notwithstanding any other provision of law, prior to the allocation or distribution of any secondary supplemental payment adjustments, hospitals that, as of July 1,\n\t\t\t\t  1995, were part of a county-operated health system of three or more eligible hospitals licensed to the county, shall be deemed to have reached the limitations on total payments described in subclause (II) of clause (v) of subparagraph (B). Data regarding payment adjustments earned by these hospitals with respect to the 1995\u201396 payment adjustment year, whether paid or payable, shall be included in the computations under subparagraph (A), but excluded from the computations under subparagraph (B).(D)\u00a0The department shall make payments of the secondary supplemental payment adjustments to hospitals on or before November 30, 1996.(10)\u00a0The final total amount of per diem payment adjustments paid by the department for the 1995\u201396 payment adjustment year, plus the final total amount of supplemental lump-sum payment adjustments and secondary supplemental payment adjustments paid by the\n\t\t\t\t  department for the 1995\u201396 payment adjustment year, shall be the maximum size of the payment adjustment program for the 1995\u201396 payment adjustment year.(11)\u00a0The department shall implement this subdivision only to the extent consistent with federal medicaid law and the Medi-Cal State Plan, and only to the extent that the department determines that federal financial participation is available. In doing so, the department shall comply with any procedures instituted by the Health Care Financing Administration in connection with Sections 447.297(d)(3) and 447.298 of Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations.(z)\u00a0(1)\u00a0(A)\u00a0Notwithstanding any other provision of law (except for subparagraph (B)), all Medi-Cal days of acute inpatient hospital service paid by or on behalf of the department that give rise to payment adjustment amounts with\n\t\t\t\t  respect to the period October 1, 1994, through June 30, 1995, shall be treated as involving 1.4 days for purposes of payment adjustments with respect to this period of time. As a result, each per diem payment adjustment amount otherwise payable to the hospital in connection with these days shall be increased by 40 percent. The Medi-Cal days in question shall be treated as involving 1.4 days toward the maximum limit set forth in paragraph (2) of subdivision (l). The Medi-Cal days in question shall be treated as involving 1.0 days for purposes of determining the hospital\u2019s annualized Medi-Cal inpatient paid days for the next applicable payment adjustment year.(B)\u00a0For the 1994\u201395 payment adjustment year, no eligible hospital shall receive total payment adjustments, including per diem payment adjustment amounts and any supplemental lump-sum payment adjustment amounts, in excess of the projected total payment adjustment amounts that were\n\t\t\t\t  computed or recomputed, as applicable, for the hospital by the department with respect to the 1994\u201395 payment adjustment year. For each hospital, this maximum figure shall not exceed the sum of the following two components:(i)\u00a0The final figure computed by the department as the hospital\u2019s total per diem composite amount (including any applicable adjustments under subdivision (p)), multiplied by 80 percent of the hospital\u2019s annualized Medi-Cal inpatient paid days.(ii)\u00a0The amount calculated by the department as the hospital\u2019s pro rata share (based on the figures for all hospitals computed under clause (i)) of the remainder determined by subtracting (I) the sum of the figures computed for all hospitals under clause (i) from (II) the final maximum state disproportionate share hospital allotment for California under applicable federal rules for the 1995 federal fiscal year.(C)\u00a0Any payment adjustment amount that otherwise would be payable to a hospital, but that is barred by subparagraph (B), shall be withheld or recouped by the department and distributed on a descending pro rata basis as part of the supplemental lump-sum distribution described in subdivision (w) to those hospitals that have not reached their maximum figures as described in subparagraph (B).(2)\u00a0(A)\u00a0Notwithstanding any other provision of law, except for subparagraph (B), all Medi-Cal days of acute inpatient hospital service paid by or on behalf of the department that give rise to payment adjustment amounts with respect to the period October 1, 1995, through June 30, 1996, shall be treated as involving 1.4 days for purposes of payment adjustments with respect to this period of time. As a result, each per diem payment adjustment amount otherwise payable to the\n\t\t\t\t  hospital in connection with these days shall be increased by 40 percent. The Medi-Cal days in question shall be treated as involving 1.4 days toward the maximum limit set forth in paragraph (2) of subdivision (l). The Medi-Cal days in question shall be treated as involving 1.0 days for purposes of determining the hospital\u2019s annualized Medi-Cal inpatient paid days for the next applicable payment adjustment year.(B)\u00a0For the 1995\u201396 payment adjustment year, no eligible hospital shall receive total payment adjustments, including per diem payment adjustment amounts, supplemental lump-sum payment adjustment amounts, and secondary supplemental payment adjustments in excess of the hospital\u2019s OBRA 1993 payment limitation as computed by the department pursuant to the Medi-Cal State Plan. No hospital shall receive secondary supplemental payment adjustments to the extent the payment adjustments would be inconsistent with paragraph (9) of\n\t\t\t\t  subdivision (y).(C)\u00a0Any payment adjustment amount that otherwise would be payable to a hospital, but that is barred by subparagraph (B), shall be withheld or recouped by the department and thereafter distributed to other eligible hospitals, refunded to transferors, or otherwise processed in accordance with this section and Section 14163.(3)\u00a0Notwithstanding any other provision of law, to the extent necessary or appropriate to implement and administer the amendments to this section enacted during the 1994 calendar year, the department may utilize an approach involving interim payments, with reconciliation to final payments within a reasonable time.(aa)\u00a0(1)\u00a0For the 1996\u201397 payment adjustment year, each eligible hospital that remains in operation as of June 30, 1997, shall also be eligible to\n\t\t\t\t  receive a supplemental lump-sum payment adjustment, that shall be payable as a result of the facility being a disproportionate share hospital in operation as of that date. The availability of supplemental lump-sum payment adjustments under this paragraph shall be determined by the department as follows:(A)\u00a0The projected total payment adjustment amount for each hospital, as determined by the department at the outset of the payment adjustment year, including any reductions arising from payment limitations under this section, shall be identified. For each hospital, this amount shall be identical to the amount that was used for the same hospital in the calculations made at the outset of the 1996\u201397 state fiscal year regarding transfer amounts under subdivision (h) of Section 14163 for that fiscal year.(B)\u00a0The total amount of all per diem payment adjustment amounts under this\n\t\t\t\t  section, whether paid or payable, that are applicable to the period July 1, 1996, through June 30, 1997, shall be determined for each hospital. The applicability of the per diem payment adjustment amounts to this period of time shall be determined in accordance with federal medicaid rules including Sections 447.297(d)(3) and 447.298 of Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations.(C)\u00a0The amount determined under subparagraph (B) for each hospital shall be subtracted from the amount identified under subparagraph (A) for each hospital. If the remainder is a positive figure for the particular hospital, the supplemental lump-sum payment adjustment for the hospital shall be the positive remainder amount, which shall be payable because the facility is a disproportionate share hospital in operation as of June 30, 1997.(D)\u00a0The department shall make interim and final payments of the\n\t\t\t\t  supplemental lump-sum payment adjustments under this paragraph on or before September 30, 1997.(2)\u00a0The department shall implement this subdivision only to the extent consistent with federal medicaid law and the Medi-Cal State Plan, and only to the extent that the department determines that federal financial participation is available. In doing so, the department shall comply with any procedures instituted by the Health Care Financing Administration in connection with Sections 447.297(d)(3) and 447.298 of Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations.(ab)\u00a0(1)\u00a0For the 1997\u201398 payment adjustment year, eligible hospitals that meet the requirements of this subdivision and that remain in operation as of September 30, 1997, shall be eligible to receive a special supplemental payment adjustment, which shall be payable as a result of the facility being a\n\t\t\t\t  disproportionate share hospital in operation as of that date. For purposes of federal medicaid rules, including Section 447.297(d) of Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations, the special supplemental payment adjustments shall be applicable to the federal fiscal year that ends on September 30, 1997.(2)\u00a0The availability of special supplemental payment adjustments under this subdivision shall be determined as follows:(A)\u00a0The final maximum state disproportionate share hospital allotment for California under the provisions of applicable federal medicaid rules shall be identified for the 1997 federal fiscal year.(B)\u00a0The total amount of all per diem payment adjustment amounts and supplemental payment adjustments under this section (exclusive of any payments under this subdivision) applicable to the 1997 federal\n\t\t\t\t  fiscal year, whether paid or payable, shall be determined. The applicability of per diem payment adjustment amounts and supplemental payment adjustments of all types to the 1997 federal fiscal year shall be determined in accordance with federal medicaid rules, including Sections 447.297(d)(3) and 447.298 of Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations.(C)\u00a0The figure determined under subparagraph (B) shall be subtracted from the figure identified under subparagraph (A). If the remainder is a positive figure, special supplemental payment adjustments shall be made under this subdivision in accordance with paragraph (3). The positive remainder shall be the maximum amount of special supplemental payment adjustments under this subdivision.(3)\u00a0(A)\u00a0For purposes of these special supplemental payment adjustments, only hospitals that can be categorized into either of\n\t\t\t\t  the two groups specified in clauses (i) and (ii) shall be eligible to receive the supplemental payment adjustments, and no hospital may qualify for more than one of the two groups. The following groups of hospitals shall be recognized:(i)\u00a0\u201cPublic hospitals,\u201d which shall include all eligible hospitals that, as of July 1, 1997, met the definition of a public hospital.(ii)\u00a0\u201cNonpublic hospitals,\u201d which shall include all eligible hospitals that, as of July 1, 1997, met the definition of a nonpublic hospital.(B)\u00a0The amount determined to be the maximum amount of special supplemental payment adjustments under subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) shall first be allocated between the two groups of hospitals referred to in subparagraph (A) as follows:(i)\u00a0\u201cPublic\n\t\t\t\t  hospitals\u201d: 74.885 percent of the maximum amount.(ii)\u00a0\u201cNonpublic hospitals\u201d: 25.115 percent of the maximum amount.(C)\u00a0The amount of funds allocated pursuant to subparagraph (B) to each of the particular groups of hospitals referred to in subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall then be distributed as special supplemental payment adjustments among the eligible hospitals within each particular group as follows:(i)\u00a0The department shall compute the projected total payment adjustment amounts for all eligible hospitals for the 1997\u201398 payment adjustment year, exclusive of any payments under this subdivision, subdivision (ad), or subdivision (af), by determining for each eligible hospital its total per diem composite amount and multiplying that figure by the maximum number of the hospital\u2019s Medi-Cal inpatient paid days determined\n\t\t\t\t  under paragraph (2) of subdivision (l). For purposes of this clause, the determinations shall be without regard to the OBRA 1993 payment limitations.(ii)\u00a0The amount computed under clause (i) for each hospital described in subparagraph (A) shall be compared to the amount that is the product of multiplying 0.95 times the OBRA 1993 payment limitation that, in accordance with applicable provisions of the Medi-Cal State Plan, the department has computed for the particular hospital for the 1997\u201398 payment adjustment year.(iii)\u00a0Where the amount computed under clause (i) for the particular hospital is equal to or exceeds the product computed for the hospital under clause (ii), the hospital shall not receive a special supplemental payment adjustment. Data regarding hospitals that have reached this limitation shall not be used for purposes of clauses (v) through (viii).(iv)\u00a0Where the amount computed under clause (i) for the particular hospital is less than the product computed for the hospital under clause (ii), the amount computed under clause (i) for the hospital shall be used for purposes of clauses (v) through (viii).(v)\u00a0The figures determined under clause (iv) for each hospital in the particular group shall be added together to determine an aggregate total for each group.(vi)\u00a0The figures determined for each hospital under clause (iv) shall be divided by the aggregate total determined under clause (v) for the particular group, yielding a percentage figure for each hospital.(vii)\u00a0The percentage figure determined for each hospital under clause (vi) shall be applied to the maximum portion of the funds allocated to\n\t\t\t\t  the particular group under subparagraph (B), to determine the hospital\u2019s pro rata share of the special supplemental lump-sum payment adjustments. Except, however, in the case of a nonpublic hospital that, as of July 1, 1997, meets the definition of a children\u2019s hospital, such pro rata share otherwise determined shall be multiplied by a factor of 1.09, yielding a modified pro rata share. The pro rata share for the other nonpublic hospitals shall be reduced accordingly, yielding a modified pro rata share, so that the maximum portion of the funds allocated to the nonpublic hospitals group will not be exceeded. The pro rata share or modified pro rata share, as applicable, for each hospital, as computed under this clause, shall also be used for all purposes relating to descending pro rata distributions under clause (viii).(viii)\u00a0In no event shall a hospital receive special supplemental payment adjustment amounts in excess of the difference between\n\t\t\t\t  the product computed for the hospital under clause (ii) and the amount computed for the hospital under clause (i). Any special supplemental payment adjustment amount, or portion thereof, that otherwise would have been payable under this paragraph to a hospital, but that is barred by this limitation, shall be distributed on a descending pro rata basis to those hospitals within the same group.(D)\u00a0The department shall make interim and final payments of the special supplemental payment adjustments to hospitals on or before February 28, 1998.(4)\u00a0The department shall implement this subdivision only if consistent with federal medicaid law and the Medi-Cal State Plan, and only if the department determines that federal financial participation is available.(ac)\u00a0Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the payment\n\t\t\t\t  adjustment program with respect to the period October 1, 1997 through June 30, 1998, shall be structured as set forth below and in subdivisions (ad) and (af). However, if the effective date of the Medi-Cal State Plan amendment relating to this subdivision is later than October 1, 1997, as approved by the federal Health Care Financing Administration, all references in this subdivision to the period October 1, 1997, through June 30, 1998, shall be references to the period that commences on that effective date and continues through June 30, 1998.(1)\u00a0(A)\u00a0The department shall utilize the computations made pursuant to clause (i) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (3) of subdivision (ab) of the projected total payment adjustment amounts for all eligible hospitals for the entire 1997\u201398 payment adjustment year, exclusive of any supplemental payments under subdivision (ab), (ad), or (af).(B)\u00a0The computed amount referred to in subparagraph (A) for each hospital shall be compared to the OBRA 1993 payment limitation that, in accordance with applicable provisions of the Medi-Cal State Plan, the department has computed for the particular hospital.(C)\u00a0Where the computed amount referred to in subparagraph (A) for the particular hospital exceeds the OBRA 1993 payment limitation for the hospital, the amount computed under subparagraph (A) shall be reduced to an amount equal to the OBRA 1993 payment limitation for the particular hospital. The amount so reduced shall be used for purposes of subparagraph (E).(D)\u00a0Where the computed amount referred to in subparagraph (A) for the particular hospital is equal to or less than the OBRA 1993 payment limitation for the hospital, the computed amount referred to in\n\t\t\t\t  subparagraph (A) shall be used for purposes of subparagraph (E).(E)\u00a0The amounts determined under subparagraphs (C) and (D) for all eligible hospitals shall be added together, yielding an aggregate sum. The aggregate sum shall be the unadjusted projected total payment adjustment program for the entire 1997\u201398 payment adjustment year, exclusive of any supplemental payments under subdivision (ab) or (ad).(2)\u00a0The initial maximum size of the payment adjustment program for the entire 1997\u201398 payment adjustment year shall be set at one billion seven hundred fifty million dollars ($1,750,000,000), exclusive of any supplemental payments under subdivision (ab) or (ad).(3)\u00a0The department shall increase or decrease the amount determined for each eligible hospital under subparagraph (C) or (D) of paragraph (1), as applicable,\n\t\t\t\t  by multiplying the amount by an identical percentage, yielding the hospital\u2019s tentative adjusted projected total payment adjustment amount for the 1997\u201398 payment adjustment year. The identical percentage figure to be used for this purpose shall be that percentage that is derived by dividing the amount set forth in paragraph (2) by the aggregate sum determined under subparagraph (E) of paragraph (1). Except, however, the amount determined for a hospital under subparagraph (C) or (D) of paragraph (1) shall not be increased if it would exceed the OBRA 1993 payment limitation for the hospital.(4)\u00a0The tentative adjusted projected total payment adjustment amount computed for each eligible hospital under paragraph (3) shall be further adjusted as follows:(A)\u00a0(i)\u00a0For each eligible hospital that met the definition of a nonpublic-converted hospital as of July 1,\n\t\t\t\t  1997, the hospital\u2019s tentative adjusted projected total payment adjustment amount shall be multiplied by a \u201cnonpublic-converted hospital adjustment factor.\u201d The applicable adjustment factor shall be that which is necessary to result in an amount, for each hospital, equal to the amount used for the particular hospital under subparagraph (E) of paragraph (1). The amount so adjusted shall be used for purposes of clause (iii).(ii)\u00a0The total amount of all per diem payment adjustment amounts under this section, whether paid or payable, applicable to the period July 1, 1997, through September 30, 1997, shall be determined for each hospital referred to in clause (i). The applicability of the per diem payment adjustment amounts to the period July 1, 1997, through September 30, 1997, shall be determined in accordance with federal medicaid rules, including Sections 447.297(d)(3) and 447.298 of Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations. However, if the\n\t\t\t\t  effective date of the Medi-Cal State Plan amendment relating to this subdivision is later than October 1, 1997, as approved by the federal Health Care Financing Administration, all determinations under this clause shall include per diem payment adjustment amounts applicable to the period July 1, 1997, through the date that is one day prior to that effective date.(iii)\u00a0The amount determined for each hospital under clause (i) shall be reduced by the amount determined under clause (ii) for the hospital. The resulting figure shall be the final adjusted projected total payment adjustment amount for the hospital for the period October 1, 1997, through June 30, 1998, which shall be paid to the hospital in accordance with paragraph (5).(B)\u00a0(i)\u00a0For each eligible hospital that met the definition of a nonpublic hospital as of July 1, 1997, the hospital\u2019s tentative\n\t\t\t\t  adjusted projected total payment adjustment amount shall be multiplied by a \u201cnonpublic hospital adjustment factor.\u201d The applicable adjustment factor shall be derived as follows:(I)\u00a0The tentative adjusted projected total payment adjustment amounts determined under paragraph (3) for each nonpublic hospital described above shall be added together.(II)\u00a0The amount identified in paragraph (2) shall be divided by 2.38. The resulting figure shall then be reduced by the sum of the amounts determined for all nonpublic-converted hospitals under clauses (ii) and (iii) of subparagraph (A).(III)\u00a0The amount computed under subclause (II) shall be divided by 2, and the result thereof further reduced by the amount of thirty-seven million five hundred thousand dollars ($37,500,000).(IV)\u00a0The applicable adjustment factor shall be that ratio that results from dividing the amount derived in subclause (III) by the amount derived in subclause (I).(ii)\u00a0The total amount of all per diem payment adjustment amounts under this section, whether paid or payable, applicable to the period July 1, 1997, through September 30, 1997, shall be determined for each hospital referred to in clause (i). The applicability of the per diem payment adjustment amounts to the period July 1, 1997, through September 30, 1997, shall be determined in accordance with federal medicaid rules including Sections 447.297(d)(3) and 447.298 of Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations. However, if the effective date of the Medi-Cal State Plan amendment relating to this subdivision is later than October 1, 1997, as approved by the federal Health Care Financing Administration, all determinations under this\n\t\t\t\t  clause shall include per diem payment adjustment amounts applicable to the period July 1, 1997, through the date that is one day prior to that effective date.(iii)\u00a0The amount determined for each hospital under clause (i) shall be reduced by the amount determined under clause (ii) for the hospital. The resulting figure shall be the final adjusted projected total payment adjustment amount for the hospital for the period October 1, 1997, through June 30, 1998, which shall be paid to the hospital in accordance with paragraph (5).(C)\u00a0(i)\u00a0For each eligible hospital that met the definition of a public hospital as of July 1, 1997, the hospital\u2019s tentative adjusted projected total payment adjustment amount shall be multiplied by a \u201cpublic hospital adjustment factor.\u201d The applicable adjustment factor shall be derived as follows:(I)\u00a0The tentative adjusted projected total payment adjustment amounts determined under paragraph (3) for each public hospital described above shall be added together.(II)\u00a0The amount identified in paragraph (2) shall be reduced by the sum of the amounts determined for all nonpublic-converted hospitals under clauses (ii) and (iii) of subparagraph (A) and the sum of the amounts determined for all nonpublic hospitals under clauses (ii) and (iii) of subparagraph (B).(III)\u00a0The applicable adjustment factor shall be that ratio that results from dividing the amount derived in subclause (II) by the amount derived in subclause (I).(ii)\u00a0The total amount of all per diem payment adjustment amounts under this section, whether paid or payable, applicable to the period\n\t\t\t\t  July 1, 1997, through September 30, 1997, shall be determined for each hospital referred to in clause (i). The applicability of the per diem payment adjustment amounts to the period July 1, 1997, through September 30, 1997, shall be determined in accordance with federal medicaid rules, including Sections 447.297(d)(3) and 447.298 of Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations. However, if the effective date of the Medi-Cal State Plan amendment relating to this subdivision is later than October 1, 1997, as approved by the federal Health Care Financing Administration, all determinations under this clause shall include per diem payment adjustment amounts applicable to the period July 1, 1997, through the date that is one day prior to that effective date.(iii)\u00a0The amount determined for each hospital under clause (i) shall be reduced by the amount determined under clause (ii) for the hospital. The resulting figure shall be the final adjusted\n\t\t\t\t  projected total payment adjustment amount for the hospital for the period October 1, 1997, through June 30, 1998, which shall be paid to the hospital in accordance with paragraph (5).(5)\u00a0The final adjusted projected total payment adjustment amount determined for each eligible hospital for the period October 1, 1997, through June 30, 1998, shall be distributed in 16 or fewer equal installments to be paid no later than the 10th and 25th day of each month during the period that commences on the effective date of the Medi-Cal State Plan amendment relating to this subdivision, as approved by the federal Health Care Financing Administration, and continues through May 25, 1998.(6)\u00a0Notwithstanding any other provision of law, for the entire 1997\u201398 payment adjustment year, no eligible hospital shall receive total payment adjustments, including per diem payment adjustments, payments under\n\t\t\t\t  this subdivision, and any supplemental payments under subdivision (ab) or (ad), in excess of the hospital\u2019s OBRA 1993 payment limitation as computed by the department pursuant to the Medi-Cal State Plan. No hospital shall receive any special supplemental payment adjustments or supplemental lump-sum payment adjustments to the extent the payments would be inconsistent with subdivision (ab) or (ad), respectively.(7)\u00a0The aggregate sum of the final adjusted projected total payment adjustment amounts computed under paragraph (4) for each eligible hospital for the period October 1, 1997, through June 30, 1998, plus the aggregate sum of the amounts determined for each eligible hospital under clause (ii) of subparagraph (A) of paragraph (4), clause (ii) of subparagraph (B) of paragraph (4) and clause (ii) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (4), shall be the maximum size of the payment adjustment program for the entire 1997\u201398 payment adjustment year,\n\t\t\t\t  exclusive of the special supplemental payment adjustments provided for under subdivision (ab) and the supplemental lump-sum payment adjustments provided for under subdivision (ad).(8)\u00a0The department shall implement this subdivision only if consistent with federal medicaid law and the Medi-Cal State Plan, and only if the department determines that federal financial participation is available.(ad)\u00a0(1)\u00a0For the 1997\u201398 payment adjustment year, eligible hospitals that meet the requirements of this subdivision and that remain in operation as of June 30, 1998, shall be eligible to receive a supplemental lump-sum payment adjustment, which shall be payable as a result of the facility being a disproportionate share hospital in operation as of that date, but only if the hospital has remained in operation for the period October 1, 1997, to June 30, 1998, inclusive.(2)\u00a0The amount of supplemental lump-sum payment adjustments available to hospitals under this subdivision shall be four hundred five million dollars ($405,000,000).(3)\u00a0(A)\u00a0For purposes of these supplemental lump-sum payment adjustments, only hospitals that can be categorized into either of the two groups specified in clauses (i) and (ii) shall be eligible to receive the supplemental payment adjustments, and no hospital may qualify for more than one of the two groups. The following groups of hospitals shall be recognized:(i)\u00a0\u201cPublic hospitals,\u201d which shall include all eligible hospitals that, as of July 1, 1997, met the definition of a public hospital.(ii)\u00a0\u201cNonpublic hospitals,\u201d which shall include all eligible hospitals that, as of\n\t\t\t\t  July 1, 1997, met the definition of a nonpublic hospital.(B)\u00a0The amount of supplemental lump-sum payment adjustments as referred to in paragraph (2) shall first be allocated between the two groups of hospitals referred to in subparagraph (A) as follows:(i)\u00a0\u201cPublic hospitals\u201d: 72.17 percent of the amount.(ii)\u00a0\u201cNonpublic hospitals\u201d: 27.83 percent of the amount.(C)\u00a0The amount of funds allocated pursuant to subparagraph (B) to each of the particular groups of hospitals referred to in subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall then be distributed as supplemental lump-sum payment adjustments among the eligible hospitals within each particular group as follows:(i)\u00a0The department shall identify for each\n\t\t\t\t  eligible hospital the total amount of payment adjustments under this section (exclusive of any payments under this subdivision and subdivision (af)) applicable to the 1997\u201398 payment adjustment year, whether paid or payable. The applicability of the payment adjustment amounts to this period of time shall be determined in accordance with federal medicaid rules, including Sections 447.297(d)(3) and 447.298 of Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations.(ii)\u00a0The amount identified for each hospital under clause (i) shall be compared to the OBRA 1993 payment limitation that, in accordance with applicable provisions of the Medi-Cal State Plan, the department has computed for the particular hospital for the 1997\u201398 payment adjustment year.(iii)\u00a0Where the amount computed under clause (i) for the particular hospital is equal to or exceeds the OBRA 1993 payment limitation for the\n\t\t\t\t  hospital, the hospital shall not receive a supplemental lump-sum payment adjustment. Data regarding hospitals that have reached this limitation shall not be used for purposes of clauses (v) through (viii).(iv)\u00a0Where the amount computed under clause (i) for the particular hospital is less than the OBRA 1993 payment limitation for the hospital, the amount computed under clause (i) minus that amount paid or payable to the hospital under subdivision (ab) shall be used for purposes of clauses (v) through (viii).(v)\u00a0The figures determined under clause (iv) for each hospital in the particular group shall be added together to determine an aggregate total for each group.(vi)\u00a0The figures determined for each hospital under clause (iv) shall be divided by the aggregate total determined under clause (v) for the particular\n\t\t\t\t  group, yielding a percentage figure for each hospital.(vii)\u00a0The percentage figure determined for each hospital under clause (vi) shall be applied to the maximum portion of the funds allocated to the particular group under subparagraph (B), to determine the hospital\u2019s pro rata share of the supplemental lump-sum payment adjustments. Except, however, in the case of a nonpublic hospital that, as of July 1, 1997, meets the definition of a children\u2019s hospital, the pro rata share otherwise determined shall be multiplied by a factor of 1.09, yielding a modified pro rata share. The pro rata share for the other nonpublic hospitals shall be reduced accordingly, yielding a modified pro rata share, so that the maximum portion of the funds allocated to the nonpublic hospitals group will not be exceeded. The pro rata share or modified pro rata share, as applicable, for each hospital, as computed under this clause, shall also be used for all purposes relating\n\t\t\t\t  to descending pro rata distributions under clause (viii).(viii)\u00a0In no event shall a hospital receive supplemental lump-sum payment adjustment amounts in excess of the difference between the OBRA 1993 payment limitation for the hospital and the amount computed for the hospital under clause (i). Any supplemental lump-sum payment adjustment amount, or portion thereof, that otherwise would have been payable under this paragraph to a hospital, but that is barred by this limitation, shall be distributed on a descending pro rata basis to those hospitals within the same group.(D)\u00a0The department shall make interim and final payments of the supplemental lump-sum payment adjustments to hospitals on or before August 15, 1998.(4)\u00a0The department shall implement this subdivision only if consistent with federal medicaid law and\n\t\t\t\t  the Medi-Cal State Plan, and only if the department determines that federal financial participation is available.(5)\u00a0Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the payment adjustments, data, and related aspects of subdivision (af) shall not be taken into account for any purpose under this subdivision, subdivision (ab), or subdivision (ac).(ae)\u00a0(1)\u00a0In the event that any provision of subdivision (ab), (ac), or (ad), as reflected in a proposed Medi-Cal State Plan amendment, is not approved by the federal Health Care Financing Administration, the director shall modify the proposed Medi-Cal State Plan amendment in a manner intended to be consistent with all applicable federal requirements. Subject to the requirements of federal law, in developing the modified proposed Medi-Cal State Plan amendment, the director shall, to the extent practicable, incorporate,\n\t\t\t\t  implement, and modify, as necessary, the payment methodologies applicable to the 1997\u201398 payment adjustment year in a manner that is as consistent as possible with the approach and intent of subdivisions (ab), (ac), and (ad), respectively.(2)\u00a0In the event that any provision of subdivision (af), (ag), (ah), (ai), or (aj), as reflected in a proposed Medi-Cal State Plan amendment, is not approved by the federal Health Care Financing Administration, the director shall modify that proposed Medi-Cal State Plan amendment in a manner intended to be consistent with all applicable federal requirements. Subject to the requirements of federal law, in developing the modified proposed Medi-Cal State Plan amendment, the director shall, to the extent practicable, incorporate, implement, and modify, as necessary, the payment methodologies applicable to the 1997\u201398, 1998\u201399, and 1999\u20132000 payment adjustment years in a manner that is as consistent as possible\n\t\t\t\t  with the approach and intent of subdivisions (af), (ag), (ah), (ai), and (aj), respectively.(3)\u00a0In the event that any provision of subdivision (ak), (al), (am), or (an), as reflected in a proposed Medi-Cal State Plan amendment, is not approved by the federal Health Care Financing Administration, the director shall modify that proposed Medi-Cal State Plan amendment in a manner intended to be consistent with all applicable federal requirements. Subject to the requirements of federal law, in developing the modified proposed Medi-Cal State Plan amendment, the director shall, to the extent practicable, and after consulting with representatives of the hospital industry, including, but not limited to, the California Healthcare Association, incorporate, implement, and modify, as necessary, the payment methodologies applicable to the 2000\u201301 payment adjustment year and subsequent payment adjustment years in a manner that is as consistent as\n\t\t\t\t  possible with the approach and intent of subdivisions (ak), (al), (am), and (an), respectively.(af)\u00a0(1)\u00a0The provisions of this subdivision shall apply for the 1997\u201398 payment adjustment year, and, for all purposes under the program, shall be implemented subsequent to the provisions of subdivisions (ab), (ac), and (ad). Under this subdivision, eligible hospitals that, as of October 1, 1997, were part of a county-operated health system of three or more eligible hospitals licensed to the county, and that are in operation as of June 30, 1998, shall be eligible to receive an additional supplemental lump-sum payment adjustment, which shall be payable as a result of the facility being a disproportionate share hospital in operation as of that date, but only if the hospital has remained in operation for the period October 1, 1997, through June 30, 1998.(2)\u00a0The maximum amount of additional supplemental lump-sum payment adjustments under this subdivision shall be one hundred sixty-six million dollars ($166,000,000).(3)\u00a0The maximum amount of funds specified under paragraph (2) shall be distributed as additional supplemental lump-sum payment adjustments among the hospitals eligible under this subdivision as follows:(A)\u00a0The department shall identify for each eligible hospital the total amount of payment adjustments under this section (exclusive of any payments under this subdivision) applicable to the 1997\u201398 payment adjustment year, whether paid or payable. The applicability of the payment adjustment amounts to this period of time shall be determined in accordance with federal medicaid rules, including Sections 447.297(d)(3) and 447.298 of Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations.(B)\u00a0The amount identified for each hospital under subparagraph (A) shall be compared to the OBRA 1993 payment limitation that, in accordance with applicable provisions of the Medi-Cal State Plan, the department has computed for the particular hospital for the 1997\u201398 payment adjustment year.(C)\u00a0Where the amount computed under subparagraph (A) for the particular hospital is equal to or exceeds the OBRA 1993 payment limitation for the hospital, the hospital shall not receive an additional supplemental lump-sum payment adjustment. Data regarding hospitals that have reached this limitation shall not be used for purposes of subparagraphs (E) through (H).(D)\u00a0Where the amount computed under subparagraph (A) for the particular hospital is less than the OBRA 1993 payment limitation for the hospital, the amount computed under\n\t\t\t\t  subparagraph (A) shall be used for purposes of subparagraphs (E) through (H).(E)\u00a0The figures determined under subparagraph (D) for each hospital eligible to receive additional supplemental lump-sum payment adjustments under this subdivision shall be added together to determine an aggregate total.(F)\u00a0The figures determined for each hospital under subparagraph (D) shall be divided by the aggregate total determined under subparagraph (E), yielding a percentage figure for each hospital.(G)\u00a0The percentage figure determined for each hospital under subparagraph (F) shall be applied to the maximum amount specified in paragraph (2), to determine the hospital\u2019s pro rata share of the additional supplemental lump-sum payment adjustments.(H)\u00a0In no event shall a\n\t\t\t\t  hospital receive additional supplemental lump-sum payment adjustment amounts in excess of the difference between the OBRA 1993 payment limitation for the hospital and the amount computed for the hospital under subparagraph (A).

For purposes of this subparagraph, these determinations shall be without regard to the OBRA 1993 payment limitations. With respect to a public hospital that, as of July 1, 1998, is part\n\t\t\t\t  of a county-operated health system of three or more eligible hospitals licensed to the county, the projected total payment adjustment amount shall be reduced by an amount equal to the amount paid or payable to the hospital under subdivision (af).(B)\u00a0The computed amount referred to in subparagraph (A) for each hospital shall be compared to the OBRA 1993 payment limitation that, in accordance with applicable provisions of the Medi-Cal State Plan, the department has computed for the particular hospital.(C)\u00a0Where the computed amount referred to in subparagraph (A) for the particular hospital exceeds the OBRA 1993 payment limitation for the hospital, the amount computed under subparagraph (A) shall be reduced to an amount equal to the OBRA 1993 payment limitation for the particular hospital. The amount so reduced shall be used for purposes of subparagraph (E). Except, however, with\n\t\t\t\t  respect to a public hospital that, as of July 1, 1998, is part of a county-operated health system of three or more eligible hospitals licensed to the county, the amount as so reduced shall be increased by an amount equal to the amount paid or payable to the hospital under subdivision (af), and used for purposes of subparagraph (E).(D)\u00a0Where the computed amount referred to in subparagraph (A) for the particular hospital is equal to or less than the OBRA 1993 payment limitation for the hospital, the computed amount referred to in subparagraph (A) shall be used for purposes of subparagraph (E). Except, however, with respect to a public hospital that, as of July 1, 1998, is part of a county-operated health system of three or more eligible hospitals licensed to the county, the computed amount shall be increased by an amount equal to the amount paid or payable to the hospital under subdivision (af), and used for purposes of subparagraph (E).(E)\u00a0The amounts determined under subparagraphs (C) and (D) for all eligible hospitals shall be added together, yielding an aggregate sum. The aggregate sum shall be the unadjusted projected total payment adjustment program for the 1998\u201399 payment adjustment year, exclusive of any supplemental payment adjustments under subdivision (ah).(2)\u00a0The initial maximum size of the payment adjustment program for the 1998\u201399 payment adjustment program shall be set at one billion seven hundred fifty million dollars ($1,750,000,000), exclusive of any supplemental payment adjustments under subdivision (ah).(3)\u00a0(A)\u00a0The department shall increase or decrease the amount determined for each eligible hospital under subparagraph (C) or (D) of paragraph (1), as applicable, by multiplying the amount by an identical\n\t\t\t\t  percentage, yielding the hospital\u2019s tentative adjusted projected total payment adjustment amount for the 1998\u201399 payment adjustment year. The identical percentage figure to be used for this purpose shall be that percentage that is derived by dividing the amount set forth in paragraph (2) by the aggregate sum determined under subparagraph (E) of paragraph (1). Except, however, the amount determined for a hospital under subparagraph (C) or (D) of paragraph (1), as applicable, shall not be increased so that it would exceed the OBRA 1993 payment limitation for the hospital, and, where that would otherwise occur, the remaining amount that would have been allocated to the particular hospital shall be reallocated to all other hospitals (that have not reached their OBRA 1993 payment limitation) on a pro rata basis so that the aggregate sum of the tentative adjusted projected total payment adjustment amounts for all hospitals equals the amount set forth in paragraph (2).(B)\u00a0(i)\u00a0With respect to a public hospital that, as of July 1, 1998, is part of a county-operated health system of three or more eligible hospitals licensed to the county, the amount determined under subparagraph (C) or (D) of paragraph (1), as applicable, shall be reduced by an amount equal to the amount paid or payable to the hospital under subdivision (af), prior to applying the OBRA 1993 payment limitation under subparagraph (A).(ii)\u00a0Notwithstanding clause (i), all other computations under subparagraph (A), including the determination of the hospital\u2019s pro rata share of any reallocations, shall be made as though the reduction described in clause (i) had not occurred.(4)\u00a0The tentative adjusted projected total payment adjustment amount computed for each eligible hospital under paragraph (3) shall\n\t\t\t\t  be further adjusted as follows:(A)\u00a0(i)\u00a0For each eligible hospital that meets the definition of a nonpublic-converted hospital as of July 1, 1998, the hospital\u2019s tentative adjusted projected total payment adjustment amount shall be multiplied by a \u201cnonpublic-converted hospital adjustment factor.\u201d The applicable adjustment factor shall be that which is necessary to result for each such hospital in an amount equal to the amount used for the particular hospital under subparagraph (E) of paragraph (1).(ii)\u00a0The resulting product shall be the final adjusted projected total payment adjustment amount for the hospital for the 1998\u201399 payment adjustment year, which shall be paid to the hospital in accordance with paragraph (5).(B)\u00a0(i)\u00a0For each eligible hospital that meets the\n\t\t\t\t  definition of a converted hospital as of July 1, 1998, the hospital\u2019s tentative adjusted projected total payment adjustment amount shall be multiplied by a \u201cconverted hospital adjustment factor.\u201d The applicable adjustment factor shall be that which is necessary to result for each such hospital in an amount equal to: (I) the maximum number of the hospital\u2019s annualized Medi-Cal inpatient paid days determined under paragraph (2) of subdivision (l); multiplied by (II) the total per diem composite amount determined for the hospital, the calculation of the per diem composite amount being restricted by a maximum low-income number of 40 percent for the hospital, regardless if the hospital\u2019s low-income number would otherwise be higher. In no case shall the product of this calculation exceed the amount used for the particular hospital under subparagraph (E) of paragraph (1).(ii)\u00a0The resulting product shall be the final adjusted projected total\n\t\t\t\t  payment adjustment amount for the hospital for the 1998\u201399 payment adjustment year, which shall be paid to the hospital in accordance with paragraph (5).(C)\u00a0(i)\u00a0For each eligible hospital that meets the definition of a nonpublic hospital as of July 1, 1998, the hospital\u2019s tentative adjusted projected total payment adjustment amount shall be multiplied by a \u201cnonpublic hospital adjustment factor.\u201d The applicable adjustment factor shall be derived as follows:(I)\u00a0The tentative adjusted projected total payment adjustment amounts determined under paragraph (3) for each nonpublic hospital described above shall be added together.(II)\u00a0The amount identified in paragraph (2) shall be divided by 2.347. The resulting figure shall then be reduced by the sum of the amounts determined for all\n\t\t\t\t  nonpublic-converted hospitals under clause (ii) of subparagraph (A) and the amounts determined for all converted hospitals under clause (ii) of subparagraph (B).(III)\u00a0The amount computed under subclause (II) shall be divided by 2, and the result thereof further reduced by the amount of thirty-seven million five hundred thousand dollars ($37,500,000).(IV)\u00a0The applicable adjustment factor shall be that ratio that results from dividing the amount derived in subclause (III) by the amount derived in subclause (I).(ii)\u00a0The resulting product shall be the final adjusted projected total payment adjustment amount for the hospital for the 1998\u201399 payment adjustment year, which shall be paid to the hospital in accordance with paragraph (5). Except, however, in no case shall the final adjusted projected total payment\n\t\t\t\t  adjustment amount exceed the hospital\u2019s OBRA 1993 payment limitation, and, where that would otherwise occur, the remaining amount that would have been allocated to the particular hospital shall be reallocated to all other nonpublic hospitals (that have not reached their OBRA 1993 payment limitation) on a pro rata basis so that the aggregate sum of the final adjusted projected total payment adjustment amounts for all nonpublic hospitals equals the amount derived in subclause (III) of clause (i).(D)\u00a0(i)\u00a0For each eligible hospital that meets the definition of a public hospital as of July 1, 1998, the hospital\u2019s tentative adjusted projected total payment adjustment amount shall be multiplied by a \u201cpublic hospital adjustment factor.\u201d The applicable adjustment factor shall be derived as follows:(I)\u00a0The tentative adjusted projected total payment adjustment amounts\n\t\t\t\t  determined under paragraph (3) for each public hospital described above shall be added together.(II)\u00a0The amount identified in paragraph (2) shall be reduced by the sum of the amounts determined for all nonpublic-converted hospitals under clause (ii) of subparagraph (A), the amounts determined for all converted hospitals under clause (ii) of subparagraph (B) and the amounts determined for all nonpublic hospitals under clause (ii) of subparagraph (C).(III)\u00a0The applicable adjustment factor shall be that ratio that results from dividing the amount derived in subclause (II) by the amount derived in subclause (I).(ii)\u00a0The product determined for each hospital under clause (i) shall be further adjusted as follows:(I)\u00a0The product shall be reduced as\n\t\t\t\t  necessary so as not to exceed the hospital\u2019s OBRA 1993 payment limitation.(II)\u00a0With respect to a public hospital that, as of July 1, 1998, is part of a county-operated health system of three or more eligible hospitals licensed to the county, the product shall, prior to the application of subclause (I), be reduced by an amount equal to the amount paid or payable to the hospital under subdivision (af).(III)\u00a0Any amounts that would otherwise have been allocated to a hospital but for the hospital\u2019s OBRA 1993 payment limitation as applied under subclause (I) shall be reallocated to all other public hospitals (that have not reached their OBRA 1993 payment limitation) on a pro rata basis. With respect to a public hospital described in subclause (II), the hospital\u2019s pro rata share of any reallocated amounts shall be based on the product derived for the hospital under clause (i).(IV)\u00a0The amount determined for each hospital pursuant to subclause (I) and subclause (II), as applicable (including the reduction under subclause (II)), plus any reallocations to the hospital under subclause (III), shall be the final adjusted projected total payment adjustment amount for the hospital for the 1998\u201399 payment adjustment year, which shall be paid to the hospital in accordance with paragraph (5).(5)\u00a0The final adjusted projected total payment adjustment amount determined for each eligible hospital for the 1998\u201399 payment adjustment year shall be distributed as set forth below.(A)\u00a0With respect to the period July 1, 1998, through September 30, 1998, payment adjustment amounts shall be payable only to those eligible hospitals that, as of July 1, 1998, were not part of a county-operated health system of three\n\t\t\t\t  or more eligible hospitals licensed to the county.(i)\u00a0The maximum amount of payment adjustments payable to eligible hospitals under this paragraph for the period of July 1, 1998, through September 30, 1998, shall be determined as follows:(I)\u00a0The maximum state disproportionate share hospitals allotment for California under the provisions of applicable federal medicaid rules shall be identified for the 1998 federal fiscal year. This maximum allotment is two billion one hundred seventeen million eight hundred ninety-nine thousand six hundred sixty-eight dollars ($2,117,899,668).(II)\u00a0The total amount of all payment adjustments under this section (exclusive of any payments under this subparagraph) applicable to the 1998 federal fiscal year, whether paid or payable, shall be determined.

To the extent that any hospital is not entitled to receive an installment that otherwise would be payable but for the hospital\u2019s failure to remain in\n\t\t\t\t  operation through the last day of a particular month, the amount that would have been paid to the hospital shall be redistributed among those hospitals within the same hospital group (as those groups are described in clauses (ii) through (v)) that remain in operation from July 1, 1998, through September 30, 1998, to be distributed on a pro rata basis.

The payment\n\t\t\t\t  adjustments shall be distributed in eight equal amounts, each payable as of the last day of each month from October 1998 through May 1999. However, no hospital shall receive an installment for any month in which the hospital does not remain in operation for the entire month.(ii)\u00a0To the extent that any hospital of either of the hospital types described in clause (iv) or (v) of subparagraph (A) is not entitled to receive an installment that otherwise would be payable but for the hospital\u2019s failure to remain in operation through the last day of a particular month, the amount that would have been paid to the hospital shall be redistributed among those hospitals of the same hospital type that remain in operation from October 1, 1998, through June 30, 1999, to be distributed on a pro rata basis. The redistributed amounts shall be payable as of June 30, 1999.(iii)\u00a0With respect to a\n\t\t\t\t  public hospital that, as of July 1, 1998, is part of a county-operated health system of three or more eligible hospitals licensed to the county, the hospital\u2019s pro rata share of any reallocations under clause (ii) shall be based on the final adjusted projected total payment adjustment amount determined for the hospital pursuant to paragraph (4), as increased by an amount equal to the amount paid or payable to the hospital under subdivision (af).(6)\u00a0Notwithstanding any other provision of law, for the 1998\u201399 payment adjustment year, no eligible hospital shall receive total payment adjustments in excess of the hospital\u2019s OBRA 1993 payment limitation as computed by the department pursuant to the Medi-Cal State Plan.(7)\u00a0The aggregate sum of the final adjusted projected total payment adjustment amounts computed under paragraph (4) for each eligible hospital shall be the maximum size\n\t\t\t\t  of the payment adjustment program for the 1998\u201399 payment adjustment year, exclusive of the supplemental payment adjustments provided for under subdivision (ah).(8)\u00a0The department shall implement this subdivision only to the extent consistent with federal medicaid law and the Medi-Cal State Plan, and only to the extent that the department determines that federal financial participation is available.(ah)\u00a0(1)\u00a0For the 1998\u201399 payment adjustment year, eligible hospitals that meet the requirements of this subdivision and that are in operation as of June 30, 1999, shall be eligible to receive a supplemental lump-sum payment adjustment, which shall be payable as a result of the facility being a disproportionate share hospital in operation as of that date, but only if the hospital has remained in operation for the period October 1, 1998, through June 30, 1999.(2)\u00a0The availability of supplemental lump-sum payment adjustments under this subdivision shall be determined as follows:(A)\u00a0The maximum state disproportionate share hospital allotment for California under the provisions of applicable federal medicaid rules shall be identified for the 1999 federal fiscal year. It is estimated that this amount will be two billion seventy-one million seven hundred seventy-four thousand nine hundred seventy-six dollars ($2,071,774,976).(B)\u00a0The total amount of all payment adjustment amounts under this section (exclusive of any payments under this subdivision) applicable to the 1999 federal fiscal year, whether paid or payable, shall be determined. The applicability of payment adjustment amounts to the 1999 federal fiscal year shall be determined in accordance with federal medicaid rules,\n\t\t\t\t  including Sections 447.297(d)(3) and 447.298 of Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations.(C)\u00a0The figure determined under subparagraph (B) shall be subtracted from the figure identified under subparagraph (A). If the remainder is a positive figure, supplemental lump-sum payment adjustments shall be made under this subdivision in accordance with paragraph (3). The positive remainder shall be the maximum amount of supplemental lump-sum payment adjustments under this subdivision.(3)\u00a0(A)\u00a0For purposes of supplemental lump-sum payment adjustments under this subdivision, only hospitals that can be categorized into either of the two groups specified in clauses (i) and (ii) below shall be eligible to receive the supplemental payment adjustments, and no hospital may qualify for more than one of the two groups. The following groups of hospitals shall be\n\t\t\t\t  recognized:(i)\u00a0\u201cPublic hospitals,\u201d which shall include all eligible hospitals that, as of July 1, 1998, met the definition of a public hospital.(ii)\u00a0\u201cNonpublic hospitals,\u201d which shall include all eligible hospitals that, as of July 1, 1998, met the definition of a nonpublic hospital.(B)\u00a0The amount determined to be the maximum amount of supplemental lump-sum payment adjustments under subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) shall first be allocated between the two groups of hospitals referred to in subparagraph (A) as follows:(i)\u00a0\u201cPublic hospitals\u201d: 72.78 percent of the maximum amount.(ii)\u00a0\u201cNonpublic hospitals\u201d: 27.22 percent of the maximum amount.(C)\u00a0The amount of funds allocated pursuant to subparagraph (B) to each of the particular groups of hospitals referred to in subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall then be distributed as supplemental lump-sum payment adjustments among the eligible hospitals within each particular group as follows:(i)\u00a0The department shall identify for each eligible hospital the total amount of payment adjustments under this section (exclusive of any payments under this subdivision) applicable to the 1998\u201399 payment adjustment year, whether paid or payable. The applicability of the payment adjustment amounts to this period of time shall be determined in accordance with federal medicaid rules, including Sections 447.297(d)(3) and 447.298 of Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations.(ii)\u00a0The amount identified for each hospital under clause (i)\n\t\t\t\t  shall be compared to the OBRA 1993 payment limitation that, in accordance with applicable provisions of the Medi-Cal State Plan, the department has computed for the particular hospital for the 1998\u201399 payment adjustment year.(iii)\u00a0Where the amount computed under clause (i) for the particular hospital is equal to or exceeds the OBRA 1993 payment limitation for the hospital, the hospital shall not receive a supplemental lump-sum payment adjustment. Data regarding hospitals that have reached this limitation shall not be used for purposes of clauses (v) through (viii).(iv)\u00a0Where the amount computed under clause (i) for the particular hospital is less than the OBRA 1993 payment limitation for the hospital, the amount computed under clause (i) shall be used for purposes of clauses (v) through (viii). Except, however, with respect to a public hospital that, as of July 1, 1998, was part\n\t\t\t\t  of a county-operated health system of three or more eligible hospitals licensed to the county, the amount computed under clause (i) plus the amounts paid or payable to the hospital pursuant to subdivision (af) shall be used for purposes of clauses (v) through (vii), while the amount computed under clause (i) only shall be used for purposes of applying the limitation described in clause (viii).(v)\u00a0The figures determined under clause (iv) for each hospital in the particular group shall be added together to determine an aggregate total for each group.(vi)\u00a0The figures determined for each hospital under clause (iv) shall be divided by the aggregate total determined under clause (v) for the particular group, yielding a percentage figure for each hospital.(vii)\u00a0The percentage figure determined for each hospital under\n\t\t\t\t  clause (vi) shall be applied to the maximum portion of the funds allocated to the particular group under subparagraph (B), to determine the hospital\u2019s pro rata share of the supplemental lump-sum payment adjustments. Except, however, in the case of a nonpublic hospital that, as of July 1, 1998, met the definition of a children\u2019s hospital, the pro rata share otherwise determined shall be multiplied by a factor of 1.09, yielding a modified pro rata share. The pro rata share for the other nonpublic hospitals shall be reduced accordingly, yielding a modified pro rata share, so that the maximum portion of the funds allocated to the nonpublic hospitals group will not be exceeded. The pro rata share or modified pro rata share, as applicable, for each hospital, as computed under this clause, shall also be used for all purposes relating to descending pro rata distributions under clause (viii).(viii)\u00a0In no event shall a hospital receive supplemental\n\t\t\t\t  lump-sum payment adjustment amounts in excess of the difference between the OBRA 1993 payment limitation for the hospital and the amount computed for the hospital under clause (i). Any supplemental lump-sum payment adjustment amount, or portion thereof, that otherwise would have been payable under this paragraph to a hospital, but that is barred by this limitation, shall be distributed on a descending pro rata basis to those hospitals within the same group.(D)\u00a0The department shall make interim and final payments of the supplemental lump-sum payment adjustments to hospitals on or before August 15, 1999.(4)\u00a0The department shall implement this subdivision only to the extent consistent with federal medicaid law and the Medi-Cal State Plan, and only to the extent that the department determines that federal financial participation is available.(ai)\u00a0Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no payment adjustment amounts shall be payable in connection with the period of July 1 through September 30 of the 1999\u20132000 payment adjustment year. The payment adjustment program with respect to the period October 1, 1999, through June 30, 2000, shall be structured as set forth below and in subdivision (aj).(1)\u00a0(A)\u00a0The department shall compute the projected total payment adjustment amounts for all eligible hospitals for the 1999\u20132000 payment adjustment year, by determining for each eligible hospital its total per diem composite amount and multiplying that figure by the maximum number of the hospital\u2019s Medi-Cal inpatient paid days determined under paragraph (2) of subdivision (l). For purposes of this subparagraph, these determinations shall be without regard to the OBRA 1993 payment limitations.(B)\u00a0The computed amount referred to in subparagraph (A) for each hospital shall be compared to the OBRA 1993 payment limitation that, in accordance with applicable provisions of the Medi-Cal State Plan, the department has computed for the particular hospital.(C)\u00a0Where the computed amount referred to in subparagraph (A) for the particular hospital exceeds the OBRA 1993 payment limitation for the hospital, the amount computed under subparagraph (A) shall be reduced to an amount equal to the OBRA 1993 payment limitation for the particular hospital. The amount so reduced shall be used for purposes of subparagraph (E).(D)\u00a0Where the computed amount referred to in subparagraph (A) for the particular hospital is equal to or less than the OBRA 1993 payment limitation for the hospital, the computed amount referred to in\n\t\t\t\t  subparagraph (A) shall be used for purposes of subparagraph (E).(E)\u00a0The amounts determined under subparagraphs (C) and (D) for all eligible hospitals shall be added together, yielding an aggregate sum. The aggregate sum shall be the unadjusted projected total payment adjustment program for the period of October 1, 1999, through June 30, 2000, exclusive of any supplemental payment adjustments under subdivision (aj).(2)\u00a0The initial maximum size of the payment adjustment program for the period October 1, 1999, through June 30, 2000, shall be set at one billion seven hundred fifty million dollars ($1,750,000,000), exclusive of any supplemental payment adjustments under subdivision (aj).(3)\u00a0The department shall increase or decrease the amount determined for each eligible hospital under subparagraph (C) or (D) of\n\t\t\t\t  paragraph (1), as applicable, by multiplying the amount by an identical percentage, yielding the hospital\u2019s tentative adjusted projected total payment adjustment amount for the period October 1, 1999, through June 30, 2000. The identical percentage figure to be used for this purpose shall be that percentage that is derived by dividing the amount set forth in paragraph (2) by the aggregate sum determined under subparagraph (E) of paragraph (1). Except, however, the amount determined for a hospital under subparagraphs (C) or (D) of paragraph (1) shall not be increased so that it would exceed the OBRA 1993 payment limitation for the hospital, and, where that would otherwise occur, the remaining amount that would have been allocated to the particular hospital shall be reallocated to all other hospitals (that have not reached their OBRA 1993 payment limitation) on a pro rata basis so that the aggregate sum of the tentative adjusted projected total payment adjustment amount for all hospitals equals the amount set\n\t\t\t\t  forth in paragraph (2).(4)\u00a0The tentative adjusted projected total payment adjustment amount computed for each eligible hospital under paragraph (3) shall be further adjusted as follows:(A)\u00a0(i)\u00a0For each eligible hospital that meets the definition of a nonpublic-converted hospital as of July 1, 1999, the hospital\u2019s tentative adjusted projected total payment adjustment amount shall be multiplied by a \u201cnonpublic-converted hospital adjustment factor.\u201d The applicable adjustment factor shall be that which is necessary to result in an amount for each such hospital equal to the amount used for the particular hospital under subparagraph (E) of paragraph (1).(ii)\u00a0The resulting product shall be the final adjusted projected total payment adjustment amount for the hospital for the period October 1, 1999,\n\t\t\t\t  through June 30, 2000, which shall be paid to the hospital in accordance with paragraph (5).(B)\u00a0(i)\u00a0For each eligible hospital that meets the definition of a converted hospital as of July 1, 1999, the hospital\u2019s tentative adjusted projected total payment adjustment amount shall be multiplied by a \u201cconverted hospital adjustment factor.\u201d The applicable adjustment factor shall be that which is necessary to result for each such hospital in an amount equal to: (I) the maximum number of the hospital\u2019s annualized Medi-Cal inpatient paid days determined under paragraph (2) of subdivision (l); multiplied by (II) the total per diem composite amount determined for the hospital, the calculation of the per diem composite amount being restricted by a maximum low-income number of 40 percent for the hospital, regardless if the hospital\u2019s low-income number would otherwise be higher. In no case shall the product of this calculation\n\t\t\t\t  exceed the amount used for the particular hospital under subparagraph (E) of paragraph (1).(ii)\u00a0The resulting product shall be the final adjusted projected total payment adjustment amount for the hospital for the period October 1, 1999, through June 30, 2000, which shall be paid to the hospital in accordance with paragraph (5).(C)\u00a0(i)\u00a0For each eligible hospital that meets the definition of a nonpublic hospital as of July 1, 1999, the hospital\u2019s tentative adjusted projected total payment adjustment amount shall be multiplied by a \u201cnonpublic hospital adjustment factor.\u201d The applicable adjustment factor shall be derived as follows:(I)\u00a0The tentative adjusted projected total payment adjustment amounts determined under paragraph (3) for each nonpublic hospital shall be added together.(II)\u00a0The amount identified in paragraph (2) shall be divided by 2.130. The resulting figure shall then be reduced by the sums of the amounts determined for all nonpublic-converted hospitals under clause (ii) of subparagraph (A) and all converted hospitals under clause (ii) of subparagraph (B).(III)\u00a0The amount computed under subclause (II) shall be divided by 2, and the result thereof further reduced by the amount of thirty-seven million five hundred thousand dollars ($37,500,000).(IV)\u00a0The applicable adjustment factor shall be that ratio that results from dividing the amount derived in subclause (III) by the amount derived in subclause (I).(ii)\u00a0The resulting product shall be the final adjusted projected total payment adjustment amount for the hospital\n\t\t\t\t  for the period October 1, 1999, through June 30, 2000, which shall be paid to the hospital in accordance with paragraph (5). Except, however, in no case shall the final adjusted projected total payment adjustment amount exceed the hospital\u2019s OBRA 1993 payment limitation, and, where that would otherwise occur, the remaining amount that would have been allocated to the particular hospital shall be reallocated to all other nonpublic hospitals (that have not reached their OBRA 1993 payment limitation) on a pro rata basis so that the aggregate sum of the final adjusted projected total payment adjustment amounts for all nonpublic hospitals equals the amount derived in subclause (III) of clause (i).(D)\u00a0(i)\u00a0For each eligible hospital that meets the definition of a public hospital as of July 1, 1999, the hospital\u2019s tentative adjusted projected total payment adjustment amount shall be multiplied by a \u201cpublic hospital adjustment\n\t\t\t\t  factor.\u201d The applicable adjustment factor shall be derived as follows:(I)\u00a0The tentative adjusted projected total payment adjustment amounts determined under paragraph (3) for each public hospital described above shall be added together.(II)\u00a0The amount identified in paragraph (2) shall be reduced by the sums of the amounts determined for all nonpublic-converted hospitals under clause (ii) of subparagraph (A) and all converted hospitals under clause (ii) of subparagraph (B), and the sum of the amounts determined for all nonpublic hospitals under clause (ii) of subparagraph (C).(III)\u00a0The applicable adjustment factor shall be that ratio that results from dividing the amount derived in subclause (II) by the amount derived in subclause (I).(ii)\u00a0The\n\t\t\t\t  resulting product shall be the final adjusted projected total payment adjustment amount for the hospital for the period October 1, 1999, through June 30, 2000, which shall be paid to the hospital in accordance with paragraph (5). Except, however, in no case shall the final adjusted projected total payment adjustment amount exceed the hospital\u2019s OBRA 1993 payment limitation, and, where that would otherwise occur, the remaining amount that would have been allocated to the particular hospital shall be reallocated to all other public hospitals (that have not reached their OBRA 1993 payment limitation) on a pro rata basis so that the aggregate sum of the final adjusted projected total payment adjustment amounts for all public hospitals equals the amount derived in subclause (II) of clause (i).(5)\u00a0(A)\u00a0The final adjusted projected total payment adjustment amount determined for each eligible hospital for the period October 1,\n\t\t\t\t  1999, through June 30, 2000, shall be distributed to the hospital in 8 equal installments, each payable as of the last day of each month from October 1999 through May 2000. However, no hospital shall receive an installment for any month in which the hospital does not remain in operation for the entire month.(B)\u00a0To the extent that any hospital of either of the hospital types described in subparagraph (C) or (D) of paragraph (4) is not entitled to receive an installment that otherwise would be payable but for the hospital\u2019s failure to remain in operation through the last day of a particular month, the amount that would have been paid to the hospital shall be redistributed among those hospitals of the same hospital type that remain in operation from October 1, 1999, through June 30, 2000, to be distributed on a pro rata basis. The redistributed amounts shall be payable as of June 30, 2000.(6)\u00a0Notwithstanding any other provision of law, with respect to a hospital that meets the definition of a public hospital as of July 1, 1999, the provisions of paragraphs (1) through (5) shall initially be implemented for the period October 1, 1999, through December 31, 1999, without application of the OBRA 1993 payment limitations. As of January 1, 2000, the department shall recalculate all determinations under paragraphs (1) through (5) for the payment adjustment year, taking into account the hospital\u2019s OBRA 1993 payment limitation as determined pursuant to federal medicaid law in existence as of January 1, 2000, and adjust, as necessary, the monthly payment installments from January 2000 through May 2000 to take into account any modifications to the recalculated amounts payable for the period October 1999 through December 1999 as may arise from the application of this paragraph.(7)\u00a0Notwithstanding any other provision of law, for the entire 1999\u20132000 payment adjustment year, no eligible hospital shall receive total payment adjustments in excess of the hospital\u2019s OBRA 1993 payment limitation as computed by the department pursuant to the Medi-Cal State Plan.(8)\u00a0The aggregate sum of the final adjusted projected total payment adjustment amounts computed under paragraph (4) for each eligible hospital for the period October 1, 1999, through June 30, 2000, shall be the maximum size of the payment adjustment program for the entire 1999\u20132000 payment adjustment year, exclusive of the supplemental payment adjustments provided for under subdivision (aj).(9)\u00a0The department shall implement this subdivision only to the extent consistent with federal medicaid law and the Medi-Cal State Plan, and only to the extent that the department determines that\n\t\t\t\t  federal financial participation is available.(aj)\u00a0(1)\u00a0For the 1999\u20132000 payment adjustment year, eligible hospitals that meet the requirements of this subdivision and that are in operation as of June 30, 2000, shall be eligible to receive a supplemental lump-sum payment adjustment, which shall be payable as a result of the facility being a disproportionate share hospital in operation as of that date, but only if the hospital has remained in operation for the period October 1, 1999, through June 30, 2000.(2)\u00a0The availability of supplemental lump-sum payment adjustments under this subdivision shall be determined as follows:(A)\u00a0The maximum state disproportionate share hospital allotment for California under the provisions of applicable federal medicaid rules shall be identified for the 2000\n\t\t\t\t  federal fiscal year.(B)\u00a0The total amount of all payment adjustment amounts under this section (exclusive of any payments under this subdivision) applicable to the 2000 federal fiscal year, whether paid or payable, shall be determined. The applicability of payment adjustment amounts to the 2000 federal fiscal year shall be determined in accordance with federal medicaid rules, including Sections 447.297(d)(3) and 447.298 of Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations.(C)\u00a0(i)\u00a0The figure determined under subparagraph (B) shall be subtracted from the figure identified under subparagraph (A).

For all purposes under this subdivision, calculations of the OBRA 1993 payment limitations for public hospitals shall not be performed prior to January 1, 2000, as referred to in paragraph (6) of subdivision (ai).(iii)\u00a0Where the amount computed under clause\n\t\t\t\t  (i) for the particular hospital is equal to or exceeds the OBRA 1993 payment limitation for the hospital, the hospital shall not receive a supplemental lump-sum payment adjustment. Data regarding hospitals that have reached this limitation shall not be used for purposes of clauses (v) through (viii).(iv)\u00a0Where the amount computed under clause (i) for the particular hospital is less than the OBRA 1993 payment limitation for the hospital, the amount computed under clause (i) shall be used for purposes of clauses (v) through (viii).(v)\u00a0The figures determined under clause (iv) for each hospital in the particular group shall be added together to determine an aggregate total for each group.(vi)\u00a0The figures determined for each hospital under clause (iv) shall be divided by the aggregate total determined under clause (v)\n\t\t\t\t  for the particular group, yielding a percentage figure for each hospital.(vii)\u00a0The percentage figure determined for each hospital under clause (vi) shall be applied to the maximum portion of the funds allocated to the particular group under subparagraph (B), to determine the hospital\u2019s pro rata share of the supplemental lump-sum payment adjustments. Except, however, in the case of a nonpublic hospital that, as of July 1, 1999, met the definition of a children\u2019s hospital, that pro rata share otherwise determined shall be multiplied by a factor of 1.09, yielding a modified pro rata share. The pro rata share for the other nonpublic hospitals shall be reduced accordingly, yielding a modified pro rata share, so that the maximum portion of the funds allocated to the nonpublic hospitals group will not be exceeded. The pro rata share or modified pro rata share, as applicable, for each hospital, as computed under this clause, shall also be used for all\n\t\t\t\t  purposes relating to descending pro rata distributions under clause (viii).(viii)\u00a0In no event shall a hospital receive supplemental lump-sum payment adjustment amounts in excess of the difference between the OBRA 1993 payment limitation for the hospital and the amount computed for the hospital under clause (i). Any supplemental lump-sum payment adjustment amount, or portion thereof, that otherwise would have been payable under this paragraph to a hospital, but that is barred by this limitation, shall be distributed on a descending pro rata basis to those hospitals within the same group.(D)\u00a0The department shall make interim and final payments of the supplemental lump-sum payment adjustments to hospitals on or before August 15, 2000.(4)\u00a0The department shall implement this subdivision only to the extent consistent\n\t\t\t\t  with federal medicaid law and the Medi-Cal State Plan, and only to the extent that the department determines that federal financial participation is available.(ak)\u00a0Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no payment adjustment amounts shall be payable in connection with the period of July 1 through September 30 of the 2000\u201301 payment adjustment year. The payment adjustment program with respect to the period October 1, 2000, through June 30, 2001, shall be structured as set forth below and in subdivision (al).(1)\u00a0(A)\u00a0The department shall compute the projected total payment adjustment amounts for all eligible hospitals for the 2000\u201301 payment adjustment year, by determining for each eligible hospital its total per diem composite amount and multiplying that figure by the maximum number of the hospital\u2019s Medi-Cal inpatient paid days determined under\n\t\t\t\t  paragraph (2) of subdivision (l). For purposes of this subparagraph, these determinations shall be without regard to the OBRA 1993 payment limitations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to a hospital that, as of July 1, 2000, meets the definition of converted hospital, the amount otherwise determined under this subparagraph shall be reduced as necessary so as not to exceed the total amount of all payment adjustment amounts payable to the hospital under this section for that payment adjustment year in which the hospital was last an eligible hospital meeting the definition of a public hospital.(B)\u00a0The computed amount referred to in subparagraph (A) for each hospital shall be compared to the OBRA 1993 payment limitation that, in accordance with applicable provisions of the Medi-Cal State Plan, the department has computed for the particular hospital.(C)\u00a0Where the\n\t\t\t\t  computed amount referred to in subparagraph (A) for the particular hospital exceeds the OBRA 1993 payment limitation for the hospital, the amount computed under subparagraph (A) shall be reduced to an amount equal to the OBRA 1993 payment limitation for the particular hospital. The amount so reduced shall be used for purposes of subparagraph (E).(D)\u00a0Where the computed amount referred to in subparagraph (A) for the particular hospital is equal to or less than the OBRA 1993 payment limitation for the hospital, the computed amount referred to in subparagraph (A) shall be used for purposes of subparagraph (E).(E)\u00a0The amounts determined under subparagraphs (C) and (D) for all eligible hospitals shall be added together, yielding an aggregate sum. The aggregate sum shall be the unadjusted projected total payment adjustment program for the period of October 1, 2000, through June 30,\n\t\t\t\t  2001, exclusive of any supplemental payment adjustments under subdivision (al).(2)\u00a0The initial maximum size of the payment adjustment program for the period October 1, 2000, through June 30, 2001, shall be set at one billion seven hundred fifty million dollars ($1,750,000,000), exclusive of any supplemental payment adjustments under subdivision (al).(3)\u00a0The department shall increase or decrease the amount determined for each eligible hospital under subparagraph (C) or (D) of paragraph (1), as applicable, by multiplying the amount by an identical percentage, yielding the hospital\u2019s tentative adjusted projected total payment adjustment amount for the period October 1, 2000, through June 30, 2001. The identical percentage figure to be used for this purpose shall be that percentage that is derived by dividing the amount set forth in paragraph (2) by the aggregate sum\n\t\t\t\t  determined under subparagraph (E) of paragraph (1). Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, the amount determined for a hospital under subparagraphs (C) or (D) of paragraph (1) shall not be increased so that it would exceed the OBRA 1993 payment limitation for the hospital, and, where that would otherwise occur, the remaining amount that would have been allocated to the particular hospital shall be reallocated to all other hospitals (that have not reached their OBRA 1993 payment limitation) on a pro rata basis so that the aggregate sum of the tentative adjusted projected total payment adjustment amount for all hospitals equals the amount set forth in paragraph (2).(4)\u00a0The tentative adjusted projected total payment adjustment amount computed for each eligible hospital under paragraph (3) shall be further adjusted as follows:(A)\u00a0(i)\u00a0For each eligible hospital\n\t\t\t\t  that meets the definition of a nonpublic-converted hospital as of July 1, 2000, the hospital\u2019s tentative adjusted projected total payment adjustment amount shall be multiplied by a \u201cnonpublic-converted hospital adjustment factor.\u201d The applicable adjustment factor for the particular hospital shall be 0.81; except however, where the hospital also meets the definition of a major teaching hospital as of July 1, 2000, the applicable adjustment factor shall be that which is necessary to result in an amount for the particular hospital equal to forty million dollars ($40,000,000).(ii)\u00a0The resulting product shall be the final adjusted projected total payment adjustment amount for the hospital for the period October 1, 2000, through June 30, 2001, which shall be paid to the hospital in accordance with paragraph (5). Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, in no case shall the final adjusted projected total payment adjustment amount exceed the hospital\u2019s\n\t\t\t\t  OBRA 1993 payment limitation.(B)\u00a0(i)\u00a0For each eligible hospital that meets the definition of a converted hospital as of July 1, 2000, the hospital\u2019s tentative adjusted projected total payment adjustment amount shall be multiplied by a \u201cconverted hospital adjustment factor,\u201d derived as follows:(I)\u00a0The maximum OBRA 1993 payment limitation specified by federal law, expressed as a maximum percentage of uncompensated care costs, that is applicable to the hospital for the 2000\u201301 payment adjustment year shall be subtracted from that maximum percentage of uncompensated care costs that the hospital was subject to as a public hospital during the 1999\u20132000 payment adjustment year.(II)\u00a0The converted hospital adjustment factor shall be that figure derived in subclause (I), expressed as a fraction,\n\t\t\t\t  subtracted from 1.00.(ii)\u00a0The resulting product shall be the final adjusted projected total payment adjustment amount for the hospital for the period October 1, 2000, through June 30, 2001, which shall be paid to the hospital in accordance with paragraph (5). Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, in no case shall the final adjusted projected total payment adjustment amount exceed the hospital\u2019s OBRA 1993 payment limitation.(C)\u00a0(i)\u00a0For each eligible hospital that meets the definition of a nonpublic hospital as of July 1, 2000, the hospital\u2019s tentative adjusted projected total payment adjustment amount shall be multiplied by a \u201cnonpublic hospital adjustment factor.\u201d The applicable adjustment factor shall be derived as follows:(I)\u00a0The tentative adjusted projected total payment adjustment\n\t\t\t\t  amounts determined under paragraph (3) for each nonpublic hospital shall be added together.(II)\u00a0The amount identified in paragraph (2) shall be divided by 2.1527.(III)\u00a0The amount derived under subclause (II) shall be reduced by the sum of the amounts determined for all nonpublic-converted hospitals under clause (ii) of subparagraph (A), and the sum of the amounts determined for all converted hospitals under clause (ii) of subparagraph (B) that exceed that amount equal to 31 percent of all payment adjustment amounts payable to each converted hospital under this section for that payment adjustment year in which the hospital was last an eligible hospital meeting the definition of a public hospital.(IV)\u00a0The amount computed under subclause (III) shall be divided by 2, and the result thereof further reduced by the\n\t\t\t\t  amount of thirty-three million five hundred thousand dollars ($33,500,000).(V)\u00a0The applicable adjustment factor shall be that ratio that results from dividing the amount derived in subclause (IV) by the amount derived in subclause (I).(ii)\u00a0The resulting product shall be the final adjusted projected total payment adjustment amount for the hospital for the period October 1, 2000, through June 30, 2001, which shall be paid to the hospital in accordance with paragraph (5). Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, in no case shall the final adjusted projected total payment adjustment amount exceed the hospital\u2019s OBRA 1993 payment limitation, and, where that would otherwise occur, the remaining amount that would have been allocated to the particular hospital shall be reallocated to all other nonpublic hospitals (that have not reached their OBRA 1993 payment limitation) on a pro rata\n\t\t\t\t  basis so that the aggregate sum of the final adjusted projected total payment adjustment amounts for all nonpublic hospitals equals the amount derived in subclause (IV) of clause (i).(D)\u00a0(i)\u00a0For each eligible hospital that meets the definition of a public hospital as of July 1, 2000, the hospital\u2019s tentative adjusted projected total payment adjustment amount shall be multiplied by a \u201cpublic hospital adjustment factor.\u201d The applicable adjustment factor shall be derived as follows:(I)\u00a0The tentative adjusted projected total payment adjustment amounts determined under paragraph (3) for each public hospital described above shall be added together.(II)\u00a0The amount identified in paragraph (2) shall be reduced by the sums of the amounts determined for all nonpublic-converted hospitals under clause\n\t\t\t\t  (ii) of subparagraph (A) and all converted hospitals under clause (ii) of subparagraph (B), and the sum of the amounts determined for all nonpublic hospitals under clause (ii) of subparagraph (C).(III)\u00a0The applicable adjustment factor shall be that ratio that results from dividing the amount derived in subclause (II) by the amount derived in subclause (I).(ii)\u00a0The resulting product shall be the final adjusted projected total payment adjustment amount for the hospital for the period October 1, 2000, through June 30, 2001, which shall be paid to the hospital in accordance with paragraph (5). Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, in no case shall the final adjusted projected total payment adjustment amount exceed the hospital\u2019s OBRA 1993 payment limitation, and, where that would otherwise occur, the remaining amount that would have been allocated to the particular hospital shall\n\t\t\t\t  be reallocated to all other public hospitals (that have not reached their OBRA 1993 payment limitation) on a pro rata basis so that the aggregate sum of the final adjusted projected total payment adjustment amounts for all public hospitals equals the amount derived in subclause (II) of clause (i).(5)\u00a0(A)\u00a0The final adjusted projected total payment adjustment amount determined for each eligible hospital for the period October 1, 2000, through June 30, 2001, shall be distributed to the hospital in 8 equal installments, each payable as of the last day of each month from October 2000 through May 2001. However, no hospital shall receive an installment for any month in which the hospital does not remain in operation for the entire month.(B)\u00a0To the extent that any hospital of either of the hospital types described in subparagraph (C) or (D) of paragraph (4) is not\n\t\t\t\t  entitled to receive an installment that otherwise would be payable but for the hospital\u2019s failure to remain in operation through the last day of a particular month, the amount that would have been paid to the hospital shall be redistributed among those hospitals of the same hospital type that remain in operation from October 1, 2000, through June 30, 2001, to be distributed on a pro rata basis.

Data regarding hospitals that have reached this limitation shall not be used for purposes of clauses (v) through (viii).(iv)\u00a0Where the amount computed under clause (i) for the particular hospital is less than the OBRA 1993 payment limitation for the hospital, the amount computed under clause (i) shall be used for purposes of clauses (v) through (viii).(v)\u00a0The figures determined under clause (iv) for each hospital in the particular group shall be added together to determine an aggregate total for each group.(vi)\u00a0The figures determined for each hospital under clause (iv) shall be divided by the aggregate total determined under clause (v) for the\n\t\t\t\t  particular group, yielding a percentage figure for each hospital.(vii)\u00a0The percentage figure determined for each hospital under clause (vi) shall be applied to the maximum portion of the funds allocated to the particular group under subparagraph (B), to determine the hospital\u2019s pro rata share of the supplemental lump-sum payment adjustments. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, in the case of a nonpublic hospital that, as of July 1, 2000, met the definition of a children\u2019s hospital, that pro rata share otherwise determined shall be multiplied by a factor of 1.69, yielding a modified pro rata share to be applied only with respect to the first one million dollars ($1,000,000) of the funds allocated pursuant to clause (ii) of subparagraph (B), and, with respect to the remainder of the funds so allocated, the pro rata share otherwise determined shall be multiplied by a factor of 1.09, yielding a modified pro rata share to be applied. The pro\n\t\t\t\t  rata share for the other nonpublic hospitals shall be reduced accordingly, yielding a modified pro rata share, so that the maximum portion of the funds allocated to the nonpublic hospitals group will not be exceeded.

For purposes of this subparagraph, these determinations shall be without regard to the OBRA 1993 payment limitations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to a hospital that, as of July 1 of the applicable payment adjustment year, meets the definition of a converted hospital, the amount otherwise determined under this subparagraph shall be reduced as necessary so as not to exceed the total amount of all payment adjustment amounts payable to the hospital under this section for that payment adjustment year in which the\n\t\t\t\t  hospital was last an eligible hospital meeting the definition of a public hospital.(B)\u00a0The computed amount referred to in subparagraph (A) for each hospital shall be compared to the OBRA 1993 payment limitation that, in accordance with applicable provisions of the Medi-Cal State Plan, the department has computed for the particular hospital.(C)\u00a0Where the computed amount referred to in subparagraph (A) for the particular hospital exceeds the OBRA 1993 payment limitation for the hospital, the amount computed under subparagraph (A) shall be reduced to an amount equal to the OBRA 1993 payment limitation for the particular hospital.

Under the Global Payment Program, GPP systems receive global payments based on the health care they provide to the uninsured, in lieu of traditional disproportionate share hospital payments and safety net care pool payments previously made available pursuant to Article 5.2 (commencing with Section 14166).(2)\u00a0The Global Payment Program is intended to streamline funding sources for care for California\u2019s remaining uninsured population, creating a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvalue-based mechanism to increase incentives to provide primary and preventive care services and other high-value services. The Global Payment Program supports GPP systems for their key role providing and promoting effective, higher value services to California\u2019s remaining uninsured. Promoting more cost-effective and higher value care means that the payment structure rewards the provision of care in more appropriate venues for patients, and will support structural changes to the care delivery system that will improve the options for treating both Medi-Cal and uninsured patients.(3)\u00a0Under the Global Payment Program, GPP systems will receive Global Payment Program payments calculated using an innovative value-based point methodology that incorporates measures of value for the patient in conjunction with the recognition of costs. To\n\t\t\t\t\t\treceive the full amount of Global Payment Program payments, a GPP system shall provide a threshold level of services, as measured in the point methodology described in paragraph (2) of subdivision (c), and based on the GPP system\u2019s historical volume, cost, and mix of services. This payment methodology is intended to support GPP systems that continue to provide services to the uninsured, while incentivizing the GPP systems to shift the overall delivery of services for the uninsured to provide more cost-effective, higher value care.(4)\u00a0The department shall implement and oversee the operation of the Global Payment Program in accordance with the Special Terms and Conditions and the requirements of this section, to maximize the amount of federal financial participation available to participating GPP systems.(c)\u00a0(1)\u00a0For each GPP program year, the department shall determine the Global Payment Program\u2019s aggregate annual limit, which is the maximum amount of funding available under the demonstration project for the Global Payment Program and which is the sum of the components described in subparagraphs (A) and (B). To the extent feasible, the aggregate annual limit shall be determined and made available by the department before the implementation of a GPP program year, and shall be updated and adjusted as necessary to reflect changes or adjustments to\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe amount of funding available for the Global Payment Program.(A)\u00a0A portion of the federal disproportionate share allotment specified for California under Section 1396r-4(f) of Title 42 of the United States Code shall be included as a component of the aggregate annual limit for each GPP program year. The amount of this portion shall equal the state\u2019s total computable disproportionate share allotment reduced by the maximum amount of funding projected for payments pursuant to subparagraphs (B) and (C) of paragraph (4) of subdivision (b) of Section 14184.30 to disproportionate share hospitals that are not participating in the Global Payment Program. For purposes of this determination, the federal disproportionate share allotment shall be aligned with the GPP program year in which the applicable federal fiscal year commences.(B)\u00a0The aggregate annual limit shall also include the amount authorized under the demonstration project for the uncompensated care component of the Global Payment Program for the applicable GPP program year, as determined pursuant to the Special Terms and Conditions.(2)\u00a0The department shall develop a methodology for valuing health care services and activities provided to the uninsured that achieves the goals of the Global Payment Program, including those values set forth in subdivision (a) and as expressed in the Special Terms and Conditions. The points assigned to a particular service or activity shall be the same across all GPP systems. Points for specific services or activities may be increased or decreased over time as the Global Payment Program progresses, to incentivize appropriate\n\t\t\t\t\t\tchanges in the mix of services provided to the uninsured. To the extent necessary, the department shall obtain federal approval for the methodology and any applicable changes to the methodology.(3)\u00a0For each GPP system, the department shall perform a baseline analysis of the GPP system\u2019s historical volume, cost, and mix of services to the uninsured to establish an annual threshold for purposes of the Global Payment Program. The annual threshold shall be measured in points established through the methodology developed pursuant to paragraph (2) and as set forth in the Special Terms and Conditions.(4)\u00a0The department shall determine a pro rata allocation percentage for each GPP system by dividing the GPP system\u2019s annual threshold determined in paragraph (3) by the sum of all GPP\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsystems\u2019 thresholds.(5)\u00a0For each GPP system, the department shall determine an annual budget the GPP system will receive if it achieves its threshold. A GPP system\u2019s annual budget shall equal the allocation percentage determined in paragraph (4) for the GPP system, multiplied by the Global Payment Program\u2019s aggregate annual limit determined in paragraph (1).(6)\u00a0If there is a change in the aggregate annual limit, the department shall adjust and recalculate each GPP system\u2019s annual threshold or the annual budget in proportion to changes in the aggregate annual limit calculated in paragraph (1) in accordance with the Special Terms and Conditions.(d)\u00a0The amount of Global Payment Program funding payable to a GPP\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsystem for a GPP program year shall be calculated as follows, subject to the Special Terms and Conditions:(1)\u00a0The full amount of a GPP system\u2019s annual budget shall be payable to the GPP system if the services it provided to the uninsured during the GPP program year, as measured and scored using the point methodology described under paragraph (2) of subdivision (c), meets or exceeds its threshold for a given year. For GPP systems that do not achieve their threshold, the amount payable to the GPP system shall equal its annual budget reduced by the proportion by which it fell short of its threshold.(2)\u00a0The department shall develop a methodology to redistribute unearned Global Payment Program funds for a given GPP program year to those GPP systems that exceeded their respective threshold\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor that same year. To the extent sufficient funds are available for all qualifying GPP systems, the GPP system\u2019s redistributed amount shall equal the GPP system\u2019s annual budget multiplied by the percentage by which the GPP system exceeded its threshold, and any remaining amounts of unearned funds will remain undistributed. If sufficient funds are unavailable to make all these payments to qualifying GPP systems, the amounts of these additional payments will be reduced for all qualifying GPP systems by the same proportion, so that the full amount of unearned Global Payment Program funds are redistributed. Redistributed payment amounts calculated pursuant to this paragraph shall be added to the amounts payable to a GPP system calculated pursuant to paragraph (1).(3)\u00a0The department shall specify a reporting schedule for participating\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGPP systems to submit an interim yearend report and a final reconciliation report for each GPP program year.
