Legal Documentation: Based on the provided legal documentation, if your landlord sells your lease 3 months before your current lease ends and is evicting you, you have the right to receive a written notice of termination. In California, for tenancies from month to month, either party may terminate the lease by giving at least 30 days' written notice. The notice should be given in the manner prescribed in Section 1162 of the Code of Civil Procedure or by sending a copy by certified or registered mail addressed to the other party. (Cal. CIV § 1946)

According to Cal. FIN § 673, if your landlord sells your lease 3 months before it ends and is evicting you, you have the right to file a claim for damages resulting from the termination of the lease. However, the claim of the landlord for damages resulting from the rejection of the lease cannot exceed the rent reserved by the lease for the year following the surrender of the premises, plus any unpaid accrued rent. You must file the claim within 30 days of the termination or within the time specified in Section 680 for filing claims, whichever is longer.

According to Cal. CCP § 1161b, if your landlord sells your lease 3 months before it ends and is evicting, you have the right to receive a 90-day written notice to quit before you can be removed from the property. If you are holding possession of the rental unit under a fixed-term residential lease that was entered into before the transfer of title at the foreclosure sale, you have the right to possession until the end of the lease term. However, the tenancy may be terminated upon 90 days' written notice to quit if certain conditions apply, such as the purchaser or successor in interest will occupy the housing unit as a primary residence.

According to Cal. CCP § 1265.140, the termination or partial termination of a lease in relation to a situation where the landlord sells the lease and is evicting you would occur at the earlier of two times: (a) when title to the property is taken by the person who will put it to public use, or (b) when the plaintiff is authorized to take possession of the property as stated in an order for possession.

Based on the provided legal documentation, if your landlord sells your lease 3 months before your current lease ends and is evicting you, you have the right to recover the worth of the excess amount of rent and charges equivalent to rent reserved in the lease for the balance of the stated term or any shorter period of time over the then reasonable rental value of the property for the same period. This right is cumulative to all other rights or remedies given to the lessor by law or by the terms of the lease. However, the lessor must exercise this remedy within a specified time or the right to recover the excess amount will be barred.

According to Cal. CIV § 789, if your landlord sells your lease 3 months before your current lease ends and is evicting you, they must give you written notice to remove from the premises within a period of not less than 30 days.

If you do so, your goods cannot be sold and will be retained by the owner until a court order is obtained. If a court order is not obtained within 30 days, you will need to pay the monthly rental charge for the space where your property is stored. If you fail to pay this rent, the owner may sell or dispose of your personal property. The owner will not be liable for the sale or disposition if you fail to secure a court order or pay the required rental charge.

However, if you have resided in the dwelling for less than one year, the owner must give you at least 30 days' notice. Additionally, the owner can give you a 30-day notice if certain conditions are met, such as the dwelling being alienable separate from any other dwelling unit and the owner having established an escrow with a bona fide purchaser. If the owner meets these requirements, they can terminate the tenancy with a 30-day notice.

According to Cal. CIV § 790, if your landlord sells your lease 3 months before your current lease ends and is evicting, you have the right to receive notice of the eviction. Once the notice has been served and the specified period has expired, the landlord may reenter or proceed according to law to recover possession.

Based on the provided legal documentation, if your landlord sells your lease 3 months before your current lease ends and is evicting you, you have the right to reclaim any personal property that you left behind in the premises.

If you fail to reclaim the property within the specified time, the landlord may dispose of it according to the law.

According to Cal. CIV § 1940.2, a landlord is prohibited from engaging in conduct that violates the tenant's quiet enjoyment of the premises or committing significant and intentional violations of Section 1954. If a landlord sells your lease and is evicting you three months before your current lease ends, you may have the right to take legal action and seek a civil penalty of up to $2,000 for each violation. However, this section does not affect a landlord's right to terminate a tenancy pursuant to existing state or local law.

According to Cal. CIV § 2987, if your landlord sells your lease 3 months before your current lease ends and is evicting you, you have the right to terminate the lease contract at any time prior to the scheduled expiration date specified in the lease contract. Your liability as a lessee shall not exceed the sum of all unpaid periodic lease payments that have accrued up to the date of termination, all other amounts due and unpaid under the lease contract, any charges assessed in connection with termination, and the difference between the adjusted capitalized cost and the sum of all depreciation and other amortized amounts accrued through the date of early termination. The realized value of the vehicle used to calculate your liability will depend on the circumstances, such as insurance coverage, appraisal, or wholesale value. However, if you terminate the lease and purchase the vehicle or trade it in for another vehicle before the scheduled expiration date, you will be relieved of any further liability under the lease contract.

According to Cal. CIV § 1951.7, if you have made an advance payment and your lease is terminated, you have the right to receive a written notice from the lessor upon the initial reletting of the property. The notice should state that the property has been relet, the name and address of the new lessee, the length of the new lease, and the amount of rent. This notice should be delivered to you personally or sent by regular mail to the address you provided within 30 days after the new lessee takes possession of the property. However, if the amount of rent due and unpaid at the time of termination exceeds the amount of the advance payment, the lessor is not required to provide this notice.

According to Cal. CIV § 1993.03, if your landlord sells your lease 3 months before your current lease ends and is evicting, the landlord must give you written notice and describe the property in a manner that allows you to identify it. The notice should also inform you of any reasonable costs of storage that may be charged before the property is returned, where the property may be claimed, and the deadline for making a claim. The notice must be personally delivered or sent by first-class mail to your last known address, and if there is reason to believe that the notice sent to that address will not be received, it should also be sent to any other address known to the landlord where you may reasonably be expected to receive the notice.

According to Cal. CIV § 1993.07, if your landlord sells your lease 3 months before it ends and is evicting you, the property described in the notice can be sold at a public sale by competitive bidding. However, if the landlord reasonably believes that the total resale value of the property is less than the threshold amount, the landlord may retain the property for their own use or dispose of it in any manner. The notice of the sale must be published in a newspaper of general circulation published in the county where the sale is to be held, and the notice must describe the property to be sold in a manner reasonably adequate to permit the owner of the property to identify it. After deduction of the costs of storage, advertising, and sale, any balance of the proceeds of the sale that is not claimed by the former tenant or an owner other than the tenant shall be paid into the treasury of the county in which the sale took place not later than 30 days after the date of sale. The former tenant or other owner may claim the balance within one year from the date of payment to the county by making an application to the county treasurer or other official designated by the county.
