            <h1> === How to Utilize Abe ===</h1>
            <div class="abe-info">
                <h3>How do I ask Abe a legal question?</h3>
                <p>Visit the <a href="{{ url_for('playground') }}">playground</a> and pose any legal question. Abe will respond based on the relevant information in the California Legal Code.</p>
                <h3>What type of legal questions can Abe answer?</h3>
                <p>Abe is equipped to address any well-phrased legal question that is rooted in the legal code. For instance:</p>
                <blockquote>Can I smoke cannabis?</blockquote>
                <h3>Which legal documents is Abe familiar with?</h3>
                <p>Abe comprehends the entire <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes.xhtml">California State legal code</a>. Rather than being specifically trained or fine-tuned on this data, he utilizes underlying algorithms to reference relevant legal sections as guidelines for his responses.</p>
                <p>While Abe operates under the assumption that all questions are within the jurisdiction of California, he can include references to specific local or federal legislation in his answers if they're part of the California legal code.</p>
                <p>Plans are in place to soon incorporate all US States and Federal Code and Regulations. The priority is to enhance the accuracy, speed, utility, and authenticity of Abe's responses before broadening the covered jurisdictions.</p>

                # Rights and privileges of a tenant when the landlord sells their lease 3 months before it ends and is evicting them

                ## TLDR

The specific rights and privileges are subject to the terms of your lease agreement and the notice given by the landlord.

However, the claim of the landlord for damages resulting from the rejection of the lease cannot exceed the rent reserved by the lease for the year succeeding the surrender of the premises, plus any unpaid accrued rent. You must file the claim within 30 days of the termination or within the time specified in Section 680 for filing claims, whichever is longer.

                # Right to purchase the property
                ## Cal. GOV § 50305
                ### Opportunity to buy or lease the property
                According to Cal. GOV § 50305, if you have been a lawful tenant of the local agency for at least 24 months during the 36 months prior to the sale or lease, you have the right to be given an opportunity to buy or lease the property at a reasonable price or rental. However, this right does not apply if you are an employee of the public agency.

                # Right to reclaim left personal property
                ## Cal. CIV § 1993.03 and Cal. CIV § 1993.04
                ### Notice requirement for abandoned property
                According to Cal. CIV § 1993.03, if your landlord sells your lease 3 months before your current lease ends and is evicting you, the landlord must give you written notice and describe the property in a manner that allows you to identify it. The notice should also inform you of any reasonable costs of storage that may be charged before the property is returned, where the property may be claimed, and the deadline for making a claim. The notice must be personally delivered or sent by first-class mail to your last known address, and if there is reason to believe that the notice sent to that address will not be received, it should also be sent to any other address known to the landlord where you may reasonably be expected to receive the notice. (Cal. CIV § 1993.03)
                ### Right to reclaim abandoned property
                According to Cal. CIV § 1993.04, if your landlord sells your lease 3 months before your current lease ends and is evicting you, you have the right to reclaim any personal property that you left behind in the premises. The landlord must provide you with a notice of right to reclaim abandoned property, which should include a description of the property and the address where it can be claimed. If you fail to reclaim the property within the specified time, the landlord may dispose of it according to the law. (Cal. CIV § 1993.04)

                # Other rights
                ## Rights tied to lease agreement and terms of notice   
                ### Cal. CIV § 827
                According to Cal. CIV § 827, if your landlord sells your lease 3 months before your current lease ends and is evicting you, your rights and privileges will depend on the terms of your lease agreement and the notice given by the landlord. Generally, the landlord can change the terms of the lease with proper written notice, which must be delivered personally or by mail. If the proposed rent increase is 10% or less, the notice must be delivered at least 30 days before the effective date of the increase. If the proposed rent increase is greater than 10%, the notice must be delivered at least 90 days before the effective date of the increase. However, if the rent increase is caused by a change in the tenant's income or family composition, the notice must be delivered at least 30 days before the effective date of the increase. It is important to review your lease agreement and consult with a legal professional for specific advice in your situation. (Cal. CIV § 827)

CIV § 1940.2, a landlord is prohibited from engaging in conduct that violates the tenant's quiet enjoyment of the premises or committing a significant and intentional violation of Section 1954. If the landlord sells your lease and is evicting you three months before your current lease ends, it may be considered a violation of your rights. You may have the right to take legal action and potentially receive a civil penalty of up to $2,000 for each violation if you prevail in a civil action. However, it is important to note that this section does not enlarge or diminish a landlord's right to terminate a tenancy pursuant to existing state or local law. (Cal. CIV § 1940.2)

                ## Rights for service members
                ### Cal. MVC § 406

The court may grant a stay of proceedings or require the tenant to make regular partial payments during the service member's period of military service. The court may also make any other order it finds to be just. Violating this section can result in liability for damages, attorney's fees, and costs, and can be punishable as a misdemeanor.

                ## Right to terminate the lease contract early
                ### Cal. CIV § 2987
                According to Cal.

The realized value of the vehicle used to calculate your liability will depend on the circumstances, such as insurance coverage, appraisal, or wholesale value. However, if you terminate the lease and purchase the vehicle or trade it in for another vehicle before the scheduled expiration date, you will be relieved of any further liability under the lease contract. (Cal. CIV § 2987)

                ## Right to submit a request to the local public agency
                ### Cal. GOV § 50308

                According to Cal. CIV § 1942, if your landlord neglects to repair dilapidations rendering the premises untenantable, you have the right to repair the premises yourself and deduct the expenses from the rent when due. Alternatively, you may choose to vacate the premises and be discharged from further payment of rent or performance of other conditions. This remedy is available to the tenant twice in any 12-month period. However, this remedy is not available if the condition was caused by the violation of Section 1929 or 1941.2. (Cal. CIV § 1942)

                ## Right to receive a written statement from the seller
                ### Cal. CIV § 1103.3

                According to Cal. CIV § 798.55, if your landlord sells your lease 3 months before it ends and is evicting you, they must provide you with a written notice to sell or remove the mobilehome from the park within a period of not less than 60 days. You have the option to either sell or remove the mobilehome within that specified period. The notice must also be sent to the legal owner, junior lienholders, and the registered owner of the mobilehome, if different from the homeowner. Additionally, if you have any past due rent and utilities, you are required to pay them upon the sale of the mobilehome. (Cal. CIV § 798.55(b)(1)(2))

If the legal owner or junior lienholder chooses to pursue termination of tenancy, they must reimburse the management for reasonable attorney's fees and court costs. If the legal owner or junior lienholder does not notify the management or perform as agreed, the management may remove the mobilehome from the premises and place it in storage, and they will have a warehouse lien against the mobilehome for the costs of dismantling, moving, and storage.
